		<p>RECENT UPDATE OF CHAOS IN FERGUSON:</p>
<p><b><i>Journalists sue St. Louis County police for alleged battery, false arrest</i></b></p>
<p><b>Politico | Hadas Gold | 3/31/15</b></p>
<p>Four journalists are filing a lawsuit against the St. Louis County police department for battery, false arrest and unreasonable search and seizure while they were covering the unrest in the city following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in August.</p>
<p>The suit is being brought by The Intercept&#8217;s Ryan Devereaux as well as German journalists Ansgar Graw, Frank Herrmann and Lukas Hermsmeier. The suit seeks unspecified punitive damages.</p>
<p>In one incident, the suit alleges Devereaux and Hermsmeier were shot at with rubber bullets while walking toward police with their hands in the air and identifying themselves as members of the media. Police then arrested the two, holding them for several hours before charging them with &#8220;refusal to disperse.&#8221;  Devereaux and Hermsmeier allege that their hands were injured as the result of plastic handcuffs they were made to wear for several hours.</p>
<p>Graw and Herrmann were arrested while trying to cover the protest and police activity at a gas station. According to the suit, Graw continued to take photographs after being told to &#8220;keep moving&#8221; by police while Herrmann questioned the directive. At that point, the police arrested the two journalists and allegedly purposely tightened the plastic handcuffs to inflict pain. When Graw asked for one of the arresting officer’s names, he replied “Donald Duck.” Both Graw and Herrmann allege that they suffered injuries from the handcuffs.</p>
<p>In both incidents, the journalists allege police complained about media coverage of the events in Ferguson. Graw and Herrmann were told they should be &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of being journalists.</p>
