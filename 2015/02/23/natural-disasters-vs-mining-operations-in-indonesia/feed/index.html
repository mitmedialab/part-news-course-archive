					<description><![CDATA[Wahyu, this looks like the start of something really interesting. I agree with Celeste - I&#039;m not sure what the timeline progression means in the current version. It would be great to see some narrative built around this visualization in the coming weeks - perhaps you can use this as a jumping off point for the data visualization assignment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Neat idea, Wahyu!

I&#039;m a little confused about the timeline of the progression that you&#039;ve animated; is this where mining activity has emerged over time? If so: 

(1) It would be great to see the disasters appear over time, along with the increase in the activity; it&#039;s hard to draw a connection between mining activity and disasters without pairing the two. 

(2) A way of indicating the start date and end date of the animation (rather than the numbers 1-511; are they number of months? years?) would also be helpful. 

At any rate, a super cool thing to visualize. If you&#039;d like to keep working on this, I&#039;m somewhat familiar with CartoDB and would be happy to help you on it!]]></description>
