					<description><![CDATA[I had used Zeega for an assignment two summers ago at Dartmouth, and I love using it! I wish I could &quot;undo&quot; within Zeega.  I really hoped to add the questions but I was running out of time, it took me too long to structure the images within Zeega.  

Thanks for your advice!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Melissa, nice job - great that you got a chance to try out Zeega! Was it pretty straightforward to use? Was there anything you wanted to do that you couldn&#039;t with this tool?

I liked the music in the piece, it felt energetic which I think works well for covering an event. I would have loved to see some of the questions people asked in the discussion afterwards, and perhaps a quote from one of the attendees. Well done.]]></description>
