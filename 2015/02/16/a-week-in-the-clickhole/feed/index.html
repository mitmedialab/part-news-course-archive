					<description><![CDATA[Liam, I really liked your approach of collating the “click” data with RescueTime data; it captures both time and content dimensions. 

In addition, I liked your insights in the last paragraph:

“Clicks and minutes both follow power laws, and generally feature similar sites at the top of both. There is a lot of correlation. Time spent may or may not be a slightly more balanced view of my online habits, but it brings its own skews. In the end, the most balanced representation of my week online probably sits somewhere in between these two metrics.”]]></description>
