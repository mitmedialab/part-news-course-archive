					<description><![CDATA[I posted a comment on Facebook saying something like this
- Dear friends living in the US. Would you please be kind enough to send me your story on how did you arrived to US? I just have four hours. 
(It was a longer message). 
And my friends sent me all those stories, some of them used video and some of them used audio. And all of them used their time at job to do it :)
I&#039;m pretty impressed by the way Facebook can work when you&#039;re recollecting life stories. I&#039;ve never tried that before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t wait to hear you talk about putting this story together - were you able to do these interviews within four hours?! It&#039;s a great example of integrating audio storytelling into a web story. It&#039;s also an interesting example of what you can do when you know a subject well and don&#039;t need to do tons of background research.]]></description>
