					<description><![CDATA[Amy, this is really impressive, and especially for someone who hasn&#039;t done a lot of this work before. You found the key tensions in the story, and the gentrification flyer is a terrific illustration. The photos do a good job of setting the scene, and you&#039;ve gone well beyond the basics of who, what and where to examine why. Think about the challenges you had in producing the piece in four hours - do they prompt ideas for how to build a better platform for this sort of reporting?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Amy, this is great. I love the photo of the flyer you found - it is very evocative of the tension you explore in this piece. It seems like this issue might be worth a follow-up story of some kind.]]></description>
