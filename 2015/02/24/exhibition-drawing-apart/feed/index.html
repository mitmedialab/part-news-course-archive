					<description><![CDATA[Yes, that was the idea at first: clicking on a picture would rebuild the image and bring some more information. I had to make it simple because of the time constraint. I think it would work well within the time frame if I had one or two partners: a journalist and a photographer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very impressive piece of design - it took me a moment to realize that this was your work and not the artist&#039;s website. Like Alexis, I wanted some way to see the full set of photos, but I enjoyed the sense of discovery. What tools did you use to present this way?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like it a lot. It&#039;s beautifully done. I would love it to be interactive. It could allow you to click in every piece to see a bigger picture with some info. The format looks very harmonious and the colors are so well disposed.]]></description>
