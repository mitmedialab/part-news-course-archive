					<description><![CDATA[HI  - I enjoyed reading this - as someone who has covered cities where malls have died and become very sad throughways, this was good to read -- suggests a city with some vibrance.  i would enjoy pics as well b/c I don&#039;t know the physical layout of this place (having walked through and been a bit lost) ... and if you&#039;d had time - either some indiv. quotes (where do all these exercisers live? where do they park?  is it weird to walk around an empty mall in the AM?) and perhaps a little history of that space as I think it&#039;s only recently been re-charged.  But this is me speaking as an editor - not as a reader.  I enjoyed the read b/c it disrupted my expectations.]]></description>
