					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the feedback ,Ethan and Alexis. I did try to combine my favorite music from The legend of the fall,but I failed. 
This is the first power point made by myself  without any help from friend.It is an easy kid game for most of you,but I thought it was hard. To finish the assignment, I tried to overcome the fear in my mind. I succeed although my works looks so simple.
I tried very hard to make a movie by Adobe premier and I-movie within half a day. But I failed. 
In the last minutes before the midnight, I changed my mind to make a powerpoint. 
So far I can not improved my skills much but the most important I learn from this assignment is that I can learn something by googleing for tips, specially in the midnight,when I can not ask anybody for help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thank you Alexis, I  am still trying to insert the file  again and again. I do not know why it can not play the music?
I am used to cooking and I did not believe a man can make a festival breakfast for our family. But He did it. I am not so necessary at the kitchen.]]></description>
