					<description><![CDATA[I think you both have very valid points! I feel so strongly that no one should feel like they&#039;re the only one having a hard time, but also that no one should feel like they have to sacrifice their happiness on some kind of altar of productivity. Sometimes I just want to take some giant sidewalk chalk and scrawl &quot;It&#039;s OK to need help&quot; or &quot;You&#039;re not alone&quot; over all the sidewalks on campus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment! As for the slogan, I really dislike it - I think it indicates that if you aren&#039;t struggling then you&#039;re not &quot;doing it right&quot; and that you should constantly be at your breaking point .  Vivian (not to speak for her, she would probably put it more eloquently) think that it highlights the idea that we&#039;re all in this together and that no one individual should feel like they are the only one struggling.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting, and I think this is a topic that could use lots of explaining. I was thinking about mental health at MIT too, and I chose to come at it from a totally different angle.
