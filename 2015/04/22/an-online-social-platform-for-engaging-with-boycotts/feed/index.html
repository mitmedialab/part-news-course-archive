					<description><![CDATA[To your point about possibly adding discussion boards other mechanisms for local support: I think that&#039;s exactly what needs to happen. One of the things I don&#039;t like about Change.org is that it&#039;s a pretty passive experience, with individual signees kind of in their own silos. For boycotts to be effective, in my view, that kind of community-wide support is necessary to sustain it.
Another thing to think about: For the app versions, would it be possible to build in a barcode scanning feature, in a manner akin to the apps Free2Work or GoodGuide? I have to imagine that it&#039;d be a lot of work, but such a feature could help take these things into people&#039;s built environments. That is, you could pick up a product, scan the barcode, and see if a WeCott boycott has been organized around that product or that company. For instance, one could scan a jar of Fancy Feast and get Wahyu&#039;s WeCott. That way, WeCott could inform and perhaps influence consumer choices, in the moment.]]></description>
