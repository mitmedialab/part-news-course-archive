			<p>RECENT UPDATE OF CHAOS IN FERGUSON:</p>
<p><b><i>Journalists sue St. Louis County police for alleged battery, false arrest</i></b></p>
<p><b>Politico |Â Hadas Gold |Â 3/31/15</b></p>
<p>Four journalists are filing a lawsuit against the St. Louis County police department for battery, false arrest and unreasonable search and seizure while they were covering the unrest in the city following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in August.</p>
<p>The suit is being brought by The Intercept&#8217;s Ryan Devereaux as well as German journalists Ansgar Graw, Frank Herrmann and Lukas Hermsmeier. The suit seeks unspecified punitive damages.</p>
<p>In one incident, the suit alleges Devereaux and Hermsmeier were shot at with rubber bullets while walking toward police with their hands in the air and identifying themselves as members of the media. Police then arrested the two, holding them for several hours before charging them with &#8220;refusal to disperse.&#8221; Â Devereaux and Hermsmeier allege that their hands were injured as the result of plastic handcuffs they were made to wear for several hours.</p>
<p>Graw and Herrmann were arrested while trying to cover the protest and police activity at a gas station. According to the suit, Graw continued to take photographs after being told to &#8220;keep moving&#8221; by police while Herrmann questioned the directive. At that point, the police arrested the two journalists and allegedly purposely tightened the plastic handcuffs to inflict pain. When Graw asked for one of the arresting officerâs names, he replied âDonald Duck.â Both Graw and Herrmann allege that they suffered injuries from the handcuffs.</p>
<p>In both incidents, the journalists allege police complained about media coverage of the events in Ferguson. Graw and Herrmann were told they should be &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of being journalists.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>From algorithms to microchips, biotech to batteries, legal battles rage on, with patent owners seeking millions or even billions of dollars of royalties from those who they say use their protected technology. But private companies arenât the only players in the high-stakes world of intellectual property. Prominent research universities and the companies they spin off have also chosen to assert their patents in court seeking large payoffs.</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V135/N5/patentviolation.html">MIT filed a lawsuit</a> against Micron Technology, a supplier of random access memory chips for several Apple products, on claims that it violated a 1997 laser-cutting patent in the production of the chips. Seeking damages and royalties on all the devices Apple sold that include the allegedly infringing chip technology, MIT stands to collect a massive sum if it is successful.</p>
<p>This is part of a growing trend of research universities going to court to assert the patents they or their spinoff companies control.</p>
<h1><b>The legal basis for university patents</b></h1>
<p>Before 1980, inventions made from federally funded research had to be turned over to be owned by the federal government. But the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act">Bayh-Dole Act</a> passed that year allowed universities to disclose and own intellectual property originating from such grants. Following the passage of the bill, many research universities started technology transfer programs â offices that help researchers patent new developments when appropriate, and which sometimes transfer patent ownership to startups in exchange for royalties or equity.</p>
<h1><b>MITâs patents</b><b>Â </b></h1>
<p>MITâs <a href="http://web.mit.edu/tlo/www/about/faq.html">Technology Licensing Office</a> serves this function for MIT. Its self-described function is advising students and faculty on whether to patent technology, assisting in the patent filing process, and transferring patents to startups for which it also helps find seed funding.</p>
<p>When, for example, a faculty member comes to TLO with a new invention, the office may advise the professor to file for a patent. The TLO will then pay the legal costs of the filing. If awarded, the royalties from the patent may be split in thirds between MIT, the inventorâs lab, and the inventor after the deduction of fees. Alternatively, if the inventor wants to use the patented technology to start a company, TLO will help find venture capitalist investment for the startup and MIT will take a âsmall percentageâ of equity in exchange for transferring or exclusively licensing the patent to the company. About 27 percent of its licenses were transferred to 16 startups in FY2013.</p>
<p>The office made nearly $80 million in FY2013, mostly from royalties and fees on patents, while it said it spent about $19 million on filing patents, a task for which it says it uses mostly outside patent counsel.<b>Â </b></p>
<p>It appears the number of patents issued to MIT has been increasing over the past few decades. <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N20/patent.20n.html"><em>The Tech</em> reported</a> the Institute was awarded 126 patents in 1992, by far the most for any university that year. MIT TLOâs <a href="http://web.mit.edu/tlo/www/downloads/ppt/TLO_stats_2013.pdf">own statistics</a> show it was awarded patents at a rate of 140 to 175 per year throughout the 2000s, but this jumped to 199 in FY2012 and 288 in FY2013.</p>
<p>The trend seems to extend to universities well beyond MIT. There were 1,491 patents issued in total to all U.S. universities in 1992. According to the Intellectual Property Owners Association, just the top seven patent-seeking universities combined <a href="http://www.academyofinventors.com/pdf/NAI-IPO-Top-100-Universities-2013.pdf">surpassed that number</a> in 2013.</p>
<h1><b>Legal Battles</b></h1>
<p>MITâs litigation against Micron over its use of RAM is asserting a patent issued to an MIT scientist and his co-inventor in 2000 but owned by MIT. The move is certainly not unprecedented for MIT, which is listed as being the plaintiff in <a href="https://search.rpxcorp.com/ent/92638-massachusetts-institute-of-technology">32 litigation campaigns</a> since 2000 by RPX, a patent litigation search engine. MITâs cases cover a wide range of industries.</p>
<p>Companies that have exclusive licenses from MIT account for some of the litigation around MIT patents, even when the company rather than MIT is leading the claim. And while most cases end in settlement, some do go to trial. In 2003, a jury awarded MIT a <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V123/N20/20lockheed.20n.html">rare patent loss</a> on its claim that a Lockheed Martin satellite phone system infringed on its speech encoding intellectual property.</p>
<p>MIT is certainly not alone as a university asserting its patents in court. RPX lists <a href="https://search.rpxcorp.com/ent/79472-leland-stanford-junior-university">Stanford</a> with 14 campaigns as plaintiff since 2000, with all its cases in the biomedical industry. Most notably, <a href="https://search.rpxcorp.com/ent/72749-trustees-of-boston-university">Boston University</a> sued many companies in a bid to assert a 1997 patent regarding a step in the production of blue LEDs. While many defendants <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2014/companies-agree-to-pay-licensing-fees-to-settle-patent-infringement-suit/">settled</a>, more suits have <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/630611/boston-u-epistar-seek-knockout-blow-in-patent-fight">continued</a>.</p>
<p>Some universities, in attempts to make unused intellectual property profitable, have turned to selling their patents. But some of these are often snapped up by non-practicing entities or âpatent trolls,â firms that exist simply to own patents and collect licensing fees, and which are quick to sue companies that they claim are infringing on their patents.</p>
<p>Trolls are widely criticized as preying upon companies without legal resources to defend themselves, trying to extract fees or settlements by claiming infringement on the sometimes absurdly broad and vague patents they own. A <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/universities-struggle-to-make-patents-pay-1.13811">study</a> published in the Stanford Law Review in 2012 found 45 universities had sold patents to a particularly notorious troll, Intellectual Ventures, or its shell companies.</p>
<p>Even if the patents donât fall into the hands of trolls, <a href="http://works.bepress.com/brian_love/4/">some contend</a> that universitiesÂ seeking to assert old patents in high-stakes court battles areÂ <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/01/20/a-bad-day-for-innovation-how-boston-universitys-1997-patent-is-hurting-research/">harming innovation</a> and betraying their principles.<b>Â </b></p>
<h1><b>The payoff</b></h1>
<p>Does it make sense for universities to engage in this type of technology licensing and transfer? A <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/11/university-start-ups-technology-transfer-valdivia">report</a> from the Brookings Institution suggests that for many universities, the answer is no. It found that for 87 percent of universities with a technology transfer office, the program did not even break even in FY2012. It also found that a fairly stable group of top-earning universities netted more than all other universities combined. MIT had one of the most profitable programs, and <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/11/start-ups-tech-transfer-valdivia/valdivia_tech-transfer_v29_no-embargo.pdf">was ranked third in the report</a>.</p>
<p>It appears MITâs TLO is profitable, making nearly $80 million in royalties and fees and spending just $19 million to file patents, but these numbers may not include its settlement wins or patent litigation fees. But even the TLO cautions other universities seeking to replicate its apparent success, âDo not expect to break even for five years or more.â</p>
<p>[In response toÂ http://tech.mit.edu/V135/N5/patentviolation.html Â I originally expected to mostly focus on MIT&#8217;s own TLO/patent history and just re-make their statistics with nicer graphs and visuals, but it turns out that the whole world of university patent lawsuits is interesting enough that I wanted to focus on digesting all the reports and information I found. I hope to expand this with more multimedia elements later.]</p>

			<p><em><strong>âMore than seven decades after the war, 100.000 bodies waiting to be foundâ (Headline in Spanish digital outlet 20 minutos).Â </strong></em></p>
<p>Every other day there is news of another mass grave found in Spain. These findings coincide with a resurgence of the divisions that lead to the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and the following for decades of dictatorship under general Franco. As families exhume the bodies of those killed during and after the conflict, and the grandchildren of the victims push for justice, Spaniards have started asking themselves if they made the right decision when they decided to impose forgiveness from the past, instead of confronting it.

Our response is to this short articleÂ from the Guardian, &#8220;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/05/can-googling-be-racist">Can Googling be Racist?</a>&#8220;.Â Â The Instagram video is a preview of the resulting story, which I plan to scan into a static web-readable series.</p>
<p>To explain, we Â supplemented Latanya Sweeney&#8217;s <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1301/1301.6822.pdf">research paper</a>Â with my own knowledge of data mining and algorithms, in a easily-digestable format. One of my biggest gripes as a computer scientist/machine-learner is the assumption that algorithms are either value-free or a mysterious black box. As Mark Twain (might have) said,</p>
<p>&#8220;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&#8221;</p>

<p>Starting off my work for the interview assignment where I explored embedding citations in a page, this is the flip-side, how can you make it easy for other people to cite you as a source, e.g. when doing an explainer. </p>
<p>Of particular interest was following the chain of citation, maybe it&#8217;s okay to cite a wikipedia article if you see where that wikipedia article is citing itself from. In the webpage, try clicking cite with text in the paragraph with a citation and without.</p>
