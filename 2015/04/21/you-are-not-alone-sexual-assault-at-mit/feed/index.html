					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s so, so important to talk about this. Kudos. I think I&#039;d recommend thinking about making sure people don&#039;t feel blamed if they decide not to speak up. I agree that speaking up is super important, but there are totally legitimate reasons not to, and there are a host of terrible examples of people being treated awfully when they do speak up, so if people don&#039;t want to for their safety, I don&#039;t blame them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great information, and a timely, important infographic. Two things.
One, you do a great job of guiding your audience through the fact that they&#039;re not alone. In fact, you do a good job overall being that supportive voice. I find it missing in the portion where you quote the survey: 

One-third of MIT students surveyed said that harassment can happen “because men get carried away.”

What&#039;s your response to that? How should your reader process this quote? What&#039;s more, I&#039;d like you to define harassment for your reader, explain that the &quot;men carried away&quot; argument doesn&#039;t hold water, outline its negative impacts, and then pivot back to the idea that saying something is for the best.

Finally, I would like you to include direct contact information for the resources you mention.]]></description>
