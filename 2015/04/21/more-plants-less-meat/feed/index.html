					<description><![CDATA[The information is great, but your retrospective assessment of the piece rings true. Grounding this in the reader&#039;s experience would make it more effective. This could be done on two fronts:
1. Maybe do a quiz up front to let people reflect on their current meat consumption. How much meat do I consume? What kinds? Have I heard about reduced-meat, vegetarian, or vegan dining options? How do I think about them? Maybe the quiz somehow allows for you to tailor the pitch you&#039;re making to each and every different reader. One reader may be interested in the environment but doesn&#039;t realize the impact of beef; another might think &quot;vegetarian&quot; and have a mental image of soggy, bland tofu. To one, maybe the environmental content is more important. For another, the idea of yummy vegetarian food is better.
Finally, really nailing the &quot;how&quot; portion will improve. So to that person who loves beef but didn&#039;t realize its environmental impact: what does that person do next? Well, they could buy grass-fed, lean beef, reduce their beef consumption in favor of organic, pasture-raised chicken, and work in more veggie proteins. Offer recommendations of products or recipes.]]></description>
