					<description><![CDATA[Amy this is terrific.  Your cartoons totally make it- inserting the interviewer&#039;s POV works really well here in the charming form of three panel cartoons.  It&#039;s less intrusive abut somehow inviting ... In other media I don&#039;t always think it&#039;s necessary but here you&#039;ve used it to wonderful effect.  I hope I see more of this.  You got me interested in your subject completely, and having these short visual asides really makes it visually friendly.  Really impressive.]]></description>
