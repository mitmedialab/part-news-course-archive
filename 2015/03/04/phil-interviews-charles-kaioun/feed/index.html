					<description><![CDATA[Phil:
Loved your nut graph (really hooks the reader)
“After scouring the web for useful information about Charles, all I found was a sparse twitter account, a non-descript bio/resume (he is a 20-handicap golfer), and a handful of links to websites. I was left wondering who is Charles Kaioun, this virtual enigma – someone who I interact with on nearly a daily basis at MIT, but who I also hardly know.”

The sound bites really animate the text of the narrative.

Would have loved to see some kind of theme in the profile in the narrative.

Overall, great work.]]></description>
