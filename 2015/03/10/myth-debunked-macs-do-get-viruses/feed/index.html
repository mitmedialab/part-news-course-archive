					<description><![CDATA[Charles, you captured the Buzzfeed style well! And I&#039;m glad there is an answer other than disconnecting ;)

I like the historical take on the issue - it might be nice to devote a bit more time to talking about contemporary viruses as well to really convince your audience.

I&#039;m curious, you mentioned some statistics in the beginning of the video about the percent of people who believe Macs are safe from viruses vs. PCs - did you conduct a survey or did you get the data from an existing source?]]></description>
