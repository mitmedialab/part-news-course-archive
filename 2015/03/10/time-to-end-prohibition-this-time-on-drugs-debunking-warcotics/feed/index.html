					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ali, 
I had the claims outlined first, but I knew already there was data to support them from reports I had read in the past. I then looked for the charts and there was plenty of data suggesting there is something wrong with the US approach to drugs. It would be interesting so see what data could come out from those with a different view on this. Best

					<description><![CDATA[David, nice job. You&#039;ve picked some graphs that succinctly make your points. What was your process for finding them? Did you have your claims outlined in advance and then go looking for the data, or did you find the charts first and construct your argument around them afterwards?]]></description>
