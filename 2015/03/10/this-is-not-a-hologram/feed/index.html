					<description><![CDATA[Carol and Bianca, nicely done! Not easy to debunk something that requires deep technical knowledge, but you pulled it off. I love that you concluded with the &quot;Why does this matter?&quot; section - I think this helps the reader feel that it&#039;s worth their time to have an opinion on the claim.

For some of the more technical parts (like the background information section), it might help to incorporate a video or some kind of moving illustration. I think this could also be a nice subject for the explainer assignment down the line!]]></description>
