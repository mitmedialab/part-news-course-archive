					<description><![CDATA[This is really good! Loved the narrative, and the tool seems amazing. May be very useful in a newsroom. Is necessary to have some background in programing to use it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Celeste and Liam, this is great story telling! You have constructed a flowing visual/textual narrative using content from the curated data. Your comments are terse and to the point and augment the impact of the narrative. Liam would love to hear about your experience with Zotero.]]></description>
