					<description><![CDATA[First, sorry for my English is not very well
Current trend against Tzuchi in Taiwan is very big. But all media just broadcast the event in their way and twist the fact.
Therfore, Tzuchi&#039;s website had the explanation of every question, and I recommend you to read each topic. THX
http://www.tzuchi.org.tw/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=section&#038;layout=blog&#038;id=60&#038;Itemid=731&#038;lang=zh
If you don&#039;t understand Chinese, I will do my best to translate to you.
Thanks for your reading and wish you have a good day.

					<description><![CDATA[Ali: True, so I guess the difficulty in picking this topic is to present the translated material and present the divergent topics of Chinese reddits into one. Interesting thing about Taiwan social media: there is not much presence of Twitter, but PTT.cc&#039;s influence is quite high (both in the way it operates like Reddit and the grassrooted nature) to the level of Facebook/Twitter influence in the States. One of my aims in this assignment, instead of showing one line of curated posts, is to sample a set of PTT.cc posts and show the correlation between the posts and actual resonance. How to truly abide to the rules of the assignment and present the materials in the way I want could be a deeper topic of discussion (possibly using other people&#039;s ideas for final project, I believe).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pau, liked the narrative of the Tzu Chi Foundation story.  I would like to see the embedded content linking to the original sources. In addition, did you look into Facebook and Twitter for curating source information for this story. One of the points of this assignment was to curtail your analysis part: “the bulk of the story should be “actualities”—the words of people affected by the situation, not your analysis.”]]></description>
