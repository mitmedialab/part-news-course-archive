					<description><![CDATA[Love the format, not sure of methodology and premise.  If premise is fthat most are not as well off ... Does that mean the experiment already has assumption it hopes to prove?  Also are the answers supposed to make me compare myself?  Overall much more inventive and engaging than I could have come up with, by far, just asking what assumptions were at outset.  We all have assumptions or a point of view so I don&#039;t mean this to be holier than thou.  Just asking.   Well done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy, Miguel, Laurie - a quiz is a really interesting format for this assignment. Initially I thought a quiz might not be the most persuasive way of delivering your facts (probably because quizzes mostly remind me of entertainment articles these days), but the design of yours is very solemn and persuasive. It does a great job of making larger facts feel personally relevant, which is one of the things that makes this so successful. Nicely done!]]></description>
