					<description><![CDATA[Elaine, I like how you combined existing research studies with data gathered from your trip to Harvard Square. I also think it is a nice approach to put your main claims in bold so readers can quickly understand your argument. 

Did you get any more responses beyond just a &#039;yes&#039; or a &#039;no&#039; (like the man you describe at the end)? Were any of the people you spoke with familiar with these research studies, or did they have other evidence to contribute to the discussion?]]></description>
