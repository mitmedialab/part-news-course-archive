					<description><![CDATA[Your interest in the long-tail and &quot;black swan&quot; evens comes out more strongly in this post than in your presentation. The trick with long tail systems is discoverability. For Amazon, this meant both indexing a massive array of products, but also working on recommendation systems to help you discover new ones. I see two challenges in asking users to curate the long tail of video content. One is the motivation question: curation takes work and is its own form of creation. Why do users curate in your system and how do you incentivize more to do it? Second, what discovery tools do your curators have to explore this content? I think that second piece will be especially critical if you want those users to do this hard work for you!]]></description>
