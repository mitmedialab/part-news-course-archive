					<description><![CDATA[Really looking forward to seeing this one on the Tech&#039;s site - I think the article you present there will serve as completion of the assignment, which involves both building the tool and writing a story with it. As you guys know, I&#039;m more interested in the sponsor side of this than the researcher side - I think it makes it easier to ask big questions: what percent of money supporting MIT is government versus commercial? What percent is private foundations? What percent is military?

I think you accomplished something very impressive with converting this massive stack of PDFs into machine readable data. Here&#039;s hoping for something next year that lets your successors focus on the data and storytelling, not on the scraping.]]></description>
