					<description><![CDATA[I think the example of linking boycotts to the nail salon example is a lovely way to introduce the WeCott idea. People can predict how much money they&#039;d likely spend on manicures, and those amounts can add up very quickly. As we discussed in class, the boycotts seem to work better conceptually when you can provide alternatives, as you&#039;ve presented in linking to the stories that look for ethical nail salons in NYC. I thought the combination of the tool and campaigns worked well, but would have liked an original story and campaign rather than one building on existing stories.]]></description>
