					<description><![CDATA[Guys, the tool is really a terrific first step. It looks very professional and clean, and returns very compelling results. I think you need to do some user-testing on the interface. I had a couple of false starts in trying to figure out what to do with it - I&#039;d recommend watching a few users try to use it and modifying based on that.

I&#039;d love to see a feature that helped you see how you compared to others within your major. The key insight that debt varies greatly per major, and that some are way better positioned to pay off debt loads is hidden at this point, and I think it&#039;s a very compelling part of your narrative.

I think the feature that attempts to match you with a community is really powerful. I think to indicate that this feature is available, you might use some pull quotes culled from those communities to signal that aspect of the tool.]]></description>
