While it lacks the power to truly get the backstory (i.e., follow the links to the source material), it nonetheless provides a short, visually attractive way of establishing that there &lt;i&gt; is &lt;/i&gt;a backstory. I can see this having value with a lot of non-news-consuming students.]]></description>
