					<description><![CDATA[Sophie, I love the hand-drawn feel, and the idea that eggs are simple, approachable and highly accessible. I think your Markov Chain story does an excellent job of showing us how simple and informative this form of storytelling can be. I&#039;m interested in your decision to link to the BBC and NYTimes - is the vision that eggs are simply short, sweet science stories with strong visuals? Or are they all going to be stories like the Markov story? I also think we&#039;d benefit from some thinking about how users who don&#039;t have your graphical skills can build this sort of story -  is there a stick figure construction kit, perhaps, ala XKCD? Or is the hope to push people to publish sketches, even if they&#039;re quite primitive? I need a clearer sense of what decisions are products of this being a prototype and which are conscious design decisions. I do like the core concept and hope you&#039;ll follow up on it.]]></description>
