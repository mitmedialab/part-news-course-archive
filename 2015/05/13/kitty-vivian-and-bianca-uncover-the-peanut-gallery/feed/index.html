					<description><![CDATA[So much to like in this project. I think the soundscape aspect is really innovative, but I can&#039;t tell how I&#039;d like it to appear on the page. I think the idea that most appeals to me is the idea that as you scroll down on the page, nearing the comments, you might hear the soundscape fade in, like you&#039;d hear the cheering or jeering at the end of a race or a performance.

Some of the aspects of the textual commenting system seem great to me - I think color coding the words to let people know when they&#039;re starting to get nasty and negative is very helpful, and I love replacing curses with hearts and flowers. I wonder if the way to implement the system is to give the platform owner control over several features, with the ability to turn different ones on if the conversation gets out of hand. I also wonder whether the ways the system deals with abusive speech make it too much fun for trolls - would people start working to get hearts and flowers?

I found the font choice for the comments very tough to read on the test site - I recommend you try something bolder and more scaleable.]]></description>
