					<description><![CDATA[Pau, the maps are beautifully done, and you&#039;ve taken on a really interesting challenge in building a framework that allows you to analyze different sets of data over time. Even knowing a little about correlation, I found the maps a little hard to read. I think they&#039;d benefit from neighborhood names when you mouse over them, and from data that helps us understand what local variable values are and how they deviate from the mean and from models. I also think a short article accompanying each map would give you a chance for explanation and context. This is a really promising direction and I hope you&#039;re going to follow it and see where it takes you.]]></description>
