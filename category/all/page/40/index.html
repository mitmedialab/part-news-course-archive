			<p>Ubiquitous computing has become an integral part of our lives. In the past week, I spent, on an average, about 13 hours everyday using some sort of computing device. Â I spent a great chunk of my time reading theory on the subjects of security, territory, population and topic modeling. I also devoted a decent amount of time to topic modeling modules that I am developing as part of my research. Â The charts below depict my daily media usage from Feb. 5 to Feb. 11.</p>
<p><em>Â <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_general_breakdown.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3473" alt="Ali_general_breakdown" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_general_breakdown.png" width="737" height="327" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_general_breakdown.png 737w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_general_breakdown-300x133.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_general_breakdown-500x221.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></a></em></p>
<p><em>Â </em></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall Mcluhan</a> defines media as â<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lnSsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=%22artificial+extensions+of+sensory+experience%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L237Uq27MKbC0AGJy4DgDQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22artificial%20extensions%20of%20sensory%20experience%22&amp;f=false">artificial extensions of sensory experience</a>.â Â But a talk about the media, as defined by Mcluhan, is impossible without bringing into discussion the ideas from the physical world because we experience the interaction of media and the physical world in the form of resemblances and analogies. While tracking all media that I encountered in the past week, I realized how media shapes and paces my day-to-day conduct. To say that I experience media in various modalities assigns a passive role to the media in my life. I would rather say that I encounter the world through the media. Below are three analogies that I found useful in understanding some aspects of this encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter and Facebook as town squares</strong></p>
<p>The town square is a public space where communities gather and interact. The function of a typical town square in pre-Renaissance Europe revolved around community interaction rather than mercantilism. Â People traveled to town square to know what was going on in the community. Their arrival and departure was constrained by physical mobilityâ i.e. they had to move from one place to another. Both Twitter and Facebook are analogous to traditional town squares, except that they are frequented more often because there are virtually no physical barriers. When I say that âI am going on Twitter or Facebookâ, I am defining my relationship to these media artifacts in terms of space. Both Twitter and Facebook are âplacesâ where I find whatâs going on in the communities that I am part of. I can interact with people in these places, or I can choose to be a passive observer. This is why I think that the metaphor of town square appropriately fits these virtual places. In the last week, I spent, on a daily basis, about 15 minutes using Twitter and about 9 minutes using Facebook. What was remarkable about my interaction with Facebook and Twitter was the daily frequency of visiting these sites: I visited Facebook about 17 times and Twitter about 30 times. So even though I was spending less than a minute on each visit on these sites, I was visiting these sites more than two times in an hour on an average.</p>
<p><strong>News and the art of scrying</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The art of scrying is an archaic idea, but we can also say that it is completely contemporary, since the art of scrying basically involves revealing the unknown. To that extent we can say that the practice of scrying is a dream of our contemporary news needs: to reveal what is happening and to predict what will happen. Technology has delimited our visible space like a scrying crystal ball. I am able to gaze at things and regions that hitherto seemed obscure. I follow news as it is happening, I analyze what has happened, and I look for indicators that are predicting what is to come. In addition, I look at news not from the perspective of a nation-stateâs subject, but rather from the perspective of a world citizen who belongs to multiple polities and communities. Â The desire to know things in real-time now is reflected in my continual attentiveness toward news websites. The chart below shows the daily frequency breakdown for my preferred news sites.<b>Â <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_news_breakdown.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3475" alt="Ali_news_breakdown" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_news_breakdown.png" width="731" height="167" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_news_breakdown.png 731w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_news_breakdown-300x68.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ali_news_breakdown-500x114.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" /></a></b></p>
<p><strong>Gmail and Skype as rhizome roots</strong></p>
<div style="width: 258px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://www.nomadology.com/rhizome.jpg" width="248" height="203" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rhizome: www.nomadology.com/rhizome.jpg</p></div>
<p>The idea that any point can be connected to another point is contained in the metaphor of rhizome. It is a metaphor that apprehends multiplicities. My world on the Internet extends my physical world. In other words, the world on the Internet, which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality">hyperreal</a>, is very much part of my territorial locus. Both Gmail and Skype allow me to interact in a rhizome reality that exists at the intersection of the real and the hyperreal. Gmail and Skype are the main means of communication and scheduling for me. Even my off-line encounters are organized by these tools. In the past week, I spent about 70 minutes using Gmail and about 15 minutes using Skype on a daily basis. These interactions, like my news usage, permeated my daily schedule on a continual basis.</p>

			<p>Consciously examining my media consumption over the past week has been a revealing exercise. In addition to looking at the breakdown of what media I consume in a week, I wanted to document what form of media I spend the most time on, how I get to it, and what times of day I spend on different platforms.</p>
<p>The simple answer: Gmail, all day.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3409" alt="report by categories" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-300x143.png" width="300" height="143" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-300x143.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-1024x489.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-500x239.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the las week I spent more than 9 hours on Gmail and scheduling tasks out of the 39 hours I logged on my computer, documented with RescueTime. A close second was writing (time spent on Microsoft Word), followed by social networking sites and news/opinion.</p>
<p>My week looked like this according to RescueTime (w/ hours logged along the vertical axis, day of the week on the horizontal axis, and a key for activity below):</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3418" alt="my week - rescuetime" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-300x113.png" width="300" height="113" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-300x113.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-1024x386.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-500x188.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in reality, my week looked a lot more like this: my daily schedule with activity color coded on top by four categories (red = email, yellow = entertainment, orange = news, pink = social media):</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3427" alt="schedule" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-300x225.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combining the data from RescueTime with a notebook log I kept of my media consumption throughout the week, I found that my news consumption tends to happen in the mornings, while I consume more topical/class-related material during the days, and I tend towards entertainment (buzzfeed, netflix) in the evenings.</p>
<p>I had three additional takeaways from this exercise:</p>
<p>1. My media consumption is socially driven</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3431" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-11 at 10.51.41 PM" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-300x192.png" width="300" height="192" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-300x192.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-1024x657.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-467x300.png 467w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM.png 1149w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that I spent a lot more time browsing Facebook and Twitter than I expected. I&#8217;m starting to realize that the reason is largely because I pick and choose to read things that my friends share on social networks. For instance, this story on NPR (Facebook link pictured above) was done by a friend of mine and shared by a lot of my friends in the Beirut journalism network. Via social media I am steered towards consuming the stories written or shared by my friends, many of whom share an interest in the Middle East. Not only do I click on these links, but, after examining the open tabs on my browser at the end of the day, I found that I am more likely to go back and actually read/listen to/consume stories shared on my social networks over other links. This concerns me that I may be stuck in a news echo chamber of sorts, dictated by my online social networks.</p>
<p>2. I am a more engaged media consumer in the mornings</p>
<p>By the end of the day, my browser looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3441" alt="tab" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-300x52.png" width="300" height="52" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-300x52.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-1024x177.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-500x86.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab.png 1157w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am much more likely to fully consume and repost or share a story if I encounter it in the morning. By the end of the day, I&#8217;m usually operating at information capacity and I&#8217;m less likely to read an article to the end.</p>
<p>3. I consume a lot of offline media</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3450" alt="photo" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-300x225.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My coursework at Fletcher keeps me reading hard copies. I spent approximately 8 hours on offline texts (I&#8217;m including my Kindle in this, but that might be a stretch). This material is predominately made up of books and journal articles related to my research and coursework at Fletcher. I&#8217;m not sure if this offline consumption is driven by the environment of being in graduate school, but it certainly cuts into the news consumption time that I spend online and on current events. It&#8217;s interesting that while I do consume offline media, very little of that media is news; rather, it is longer magazine or academic articles or books.</p>

<p>What would your life look like if you didnât have a smartphone? Or an iPad? Would you consume less news? Or just get it in a different way?</p>
<p>This week I tried to answer some of these questions by logging my activities online and offline. I recently stopped using my iPhone (on purpose) and my iPad (not on purpose&#8211;it got dropped), and our assignment this week allowed me track how I doâand donâtâconsume media in my current low-tech environment. My tools at hand were a MacBook Pro, a Kindle, and good olâ pencil and paper.</p>
<p>Even before I began, I knew that I was consuming less media that I used to back in the days when I carried an iPhone and a Blackberry at all times and immersed myself in a constant news stream, day and night.</p>
<p>But it really surprised me to quantify exactly how little news I read this week. I hardly consumed any breaking news media&#8211;just 114 minutes. I barely wrote any emails, averaging 46 minutes a day on gmail. And I spent only three minutes on Facebook.</p>
<p>Partly, this was due to circumstancesâI happened to spent a lot of time travelling and a lot of time trying to write code during this period. Over a five-day period, my activity chart looked something like this. I tracked my hours using RescueTime for computer-based activities and a notebook for everything else, and compiled the results in Excel:</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2014/02/12/leslies-media-diary/chart-one/" rel="attachment wp-att-3417"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3417" alt="Chart One" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-One-300x173.png" width="300" height="173" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-One-300x173.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-One-500x289.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-One.png 902w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>My most frequent activities were programming (369 mins), attending class (255 mins), and writing emails (231 mins). In fourth place was reading long-form journalism, which brings me to my next chart: media consumption. Iâve defined media in three categoriesâbooks, long-form and news.Â  This week I spent time reading long-form journalism for my narrative nonfiction class, which was my top category in terms of hours spent:</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2014/02/12/leslies-media-diary/chart-two/" rel="attachment wp-att-3419"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3419" alt="Chart Two" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Two-300x143.png" width="300" height="143" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Two-300x143.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Two-500x238.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Two.png 752w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The news that I read was a bit of a jumble. Here are my top news sites by time spent (for short news stories):</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2014/02/12/leslies-media-diary/chart-three/" rel="attachment wp-att-3423"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3423" alt="Chart Three" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Three-300x210.png" width="300" height="210" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Three-300x210.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Three-426x300.png 426w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Three.png 896w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>I also tracked what devices I used to consume media, and the result surprised me: I read a lot more on my kindle than on my computer.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown for what devices I used when reading books, news and long form, by minutes spent. I suspect this would have been pretty different if I was using an iPhone or an iPad:</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2014/02/12/leslies-media-diary/chart-four/" rel="attachment wp-att-3426"><img alt="Chart Four" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart-Four-300x180.png" width="300" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>By comparison when I did the same breakdown for my activities overall, my computer was dominant, accounting for 81% of my time logged. It seems like life without a smartphone has me spending more time on my kindle, and more time reading long-form journalism instead of news stories.</p>
<p>So is it worth living without an iPhone or an iPad? For the time being, absolutely.</p>

			<p>I consume medias mainly on PC, Kindle,Mobile phone,TV,printed media and organic relation (oral:talking with people, physical:dance workshop). I used &#8220;Rescue Time&#8221; for my PC, and as for other medias, I took notes and summed them up.</p>
<p>While setting up my PC for Rescue Time, I encountered something very surprising.</p>
<p>On Rescue Time, you categorize your activity on PC either as &#8220;distractive&#8221; or asÂ  &#8220;productive&#8221;. Checking news is part of my work life for more than 20 years. So I categorized &#8220;News &amp; Opinion&#8221; as &#8220;productive&#8221;. There came an alert &#8220;Most people categorize this as &#8220;distracting time&#8221;.</p>
<p>WHAAAAAT!! When I was on shift as a page editor, I had to read all 5 national newspapers from top to endÂ  for 3 hours in early morning before go to work. And you call it &#8220;distracting time&#8221;!Â  (Of course you can persist and set it up as &#8220;productive&#8221; in Rescue Time)</p>
<p>OK! Calm down. Here is a very important key for news industry. People want to be productive. But most people think reading news or opinion as distracitve, because it&#8217;s passive, I guess. If we can let people consume news in productive way, there could be a break through for the future.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to homework. Here is the summary of the time I spent for the different media.(numbers are minutes I spent)</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph01ã®ã³ãã¼.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3445" alt="graph01ã®ã³ãã¼" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph01ã®ã³ãã¼-300x180.png" width="300" height="180" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph01ã®ã³ãã¼-300x180.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph01ã®ã³ãã¼.png 481w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>I spent702 min. for mail. Half of them are for the report and message sent back to Japan, so that is for business. &#8220;Oral&#8221; does not include chatting at the lunch, but group meeting.&#8221;Physical&#8221; refers to dance lesson and dance workshop.</p>
<p>As I have been working in the media industry, I tend to use both old and new media. If I put them on timeline, you can see different aspect.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/partmedia.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3433" alt="partmedia" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/partmedia-300x156.png" width="300" height="156" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/partmedia-300x156.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/partmedia-500x261.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/partmedia.png 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>I use mobile phone as an alarm clock. So I sleep with mobile and Kindle. Whenever I wake up at night, I check my mobile for news. When earthquake happen while I am sleeping , I usually wake up at the primary wave and check the data and news on mobile. If it is bigger than M5, I turn on TV and PC.Thus the first screen I see in the morning is mobile.</p>
<p>Then I check TV news. First CNN, surfing through big networks then lands on CNN again.</p>
<p>During daytime, I use mainly PC, but also mobile when I am on move.The evening time is for printed media and Kindle. The last screen I see is mobile again.</p>
<p>This pattern is created after a long time of experience. If anything big happens, I have to go to the newsroom, I have to make phone calls.</p>
<p>How do I choose the media I consume?</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph02ã®ã³ãã¼.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3446" alt="graph02ã®ã³ãã¼" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph02ã®ã³ãã¼-300x217.png" width="300" height="217" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph02ã®ã³ãã¼-300x217.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph02ã®ã³ãã¼-413x300.png 413w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/graph02ã®ã³ãã¼.png 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>I spent 140 minutes, which is almost a quarter of time I spent for media, at the media introduced through social media. They are mainly technology and business information.</p>
<p>There are several news sites and data site which I constantly check. It is like police car checking several points on patrol. There I check top stories and then shop around. It is like &#8220;Things to do &#8221; list.Â  This patter must be quite different from young people, but having several media which I need to check for work, I cannot help.</p>

<p>For aÂ more detailed overview of my media consumption, clickÂ <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png"><a href="http://www.googlish.com/Media">here</a></a>Â !<a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3396" alt="media-consume" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png" width="1212" height="565" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png 1212w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume-300x139.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume-1024x477.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume-500x233.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">After trying to figure out which tool I could use to track my media consumption, I immediately encountered a problem: I have 3 different computers that I use regularly depending on my location (my old computer which always stays home, my new computer which resides at the Berkman center, and my netbook which always follows me along), 2 phones which I often use to check my emails or skype, and I sometimes rely on analog media, just as books. I could therefore not figure out a single application that would collect data about my media consumption simultaneously on all devices.. so I decided to keep track of it myself.Â <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoCMvT0NORh9dFk5UW82dGMzQnlkN0dXclRhamE5TVE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0">Here</a>Â is the spreadsheet that came out of it.<br />
In addition to measuring my media consumption, my curiosity brought me to also collect the main topics of consumption. I tried to classify every piece of information that I gathered from media into broad categories, so as to be able to subsequently assess the correlation existing between the media I consume and the type of content or information I get exposed to.<br />
After fiddling with various tools for datavisualisation, I ended up picking up d3.js &#8211; a very powerful tool for creativing beautiful data visualisations in (almost) no time &#8211; at least once you&#8217;ve figured out how to use it.. The current visualisations are not that exciting, of course, but that&#8217;s all I managed to get done for this first attempt at learning the tool.<br />
The result was quite surprising as I realised that my media consumption during the week was limited to a very small number of very specific topics, which are not in fact at all representative of how I perceived my interested to be:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Art was the great winner, with over 26 hours over the whole week. Of course, this was greatly related to the fact that I spent most of my week working with colleagues on our Burning Man proposal whose deadline is next week, so a large part of my &#8220;Conversations&#8221; this week were related to &#8220;Art&#8221;.</li>
<li>Programming was (surprisingly) the second, with over 10 hours of exposure. This is, in reality, not so surprising, considering that I was actually learning how to use d3 for this very assignment, so I had to spend many hours browsing the web in order to figure out how to achieve my goals.</li>
<li>Science-Fiction was third, also over 10 hours of exposure. I did not expect it at all, since I&#8217;m actually not a Science fiction freak, but then again I am currently reading a science fiction book and I&#8217;ve been watching various Sci-Fi movies that week, so it probably makes sense.</li>
<li>The rest basically amounts to my research topics: surveillance, antitrust, bitcoin, copyright, privacy and mesh networking, which when summed together amount to over 40 hours of exposure during the whole week. A result that did not surprise me at all.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The other interesting result of this analysis was derived the relative proportion of media I have been consuming over the week. Web is naturally the number one (with over 36 hours of consumption), which is not surprising since most of the information I seek comes from the web &#8211; although I did in fact expect my weekly exposure to the Web to be even higher than 36 hours. But what was highly surprising to me was to realize that the &#8220;Web&#8221; medium was so closely followed by &#8220;Conversation&#8221; (with over 33 hours of exposure). Of course, one might argue that &#8220;conversation&#8221; is not a medium in itself.. yet, as I compiled the spreadsheet, I carefully marked down only these conversation that were actually exposing me to new information, or that involved some kind of collaborative information construction.<br />
This made me reflect upon the actual definition of &#8220;media&#8221;. I personally never really thought about what is or is not a medium, in fact, I consider myself to be extremely ignorant as regards media. So this is probably not the proper definition of &#8220;media&#8221;, but according to my personal view, &#8220;media&#8221; is whatever convey information or allow someone to communicate &#8211; which is why I decided to include &#8220;conversations&#8221; whithin the media category.<br />
Overall, I think this was an extremely interesting exercise, which allowed me to become more aware, and to pay more attention to my media consumption. While I think the weekly &#8220;topics&#8221; were slightly biased or contaminated by circumstancial factors, I was happy to discover that &#8220;conversations&#8221; play such an important role in my media consumption. Since I arrived in Boston 3 months ago, I have found myself complaining about how difficult it is to get any work done in such a mentally stimulating environment such as the Berkman Center and the MIT Medialab. Now, I can finally justify it on being one of my main sources of information ;).<br />
I also really enjoyed the process of figuring out how to transform a basic spreadsheet into something meaningful and visually enticing &#8211; which allowed me to discover the potential of d3 as a datavisualisaton tool, and to come back to my somewhat rusty programming skills.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This was an interesting and challenging assignment. Defining what to include as media consumption, figuring out how to measure it, and summarizing the mass of data in a reasonable form were some of the design decisions I had to make. I decided to provide qualitative observations on my offline and mobile access and then try to âdeep diveâ into my web history to gain further insights into what I consume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Offline Media</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Print: I donât currently subscribe to any newspapers or magazines. I picked up and skimmed the MIT student newspaper (the Tech) and the newsletter of the graduate dorm I live in (Sidney Pacific). The elevators of Sidney Pacific have a wide array of posters that I inevitably see every day. A common characteristic of the print media I consume is that they are simply there.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Elevator posters on February 8.</p>

<li>
<p dir="ltr">Television: I watched the Olympic opening ceremonies on Friday, February 7 for two to three hours. I also turned on the television at a few points this week, out of habit. Usually, I channel surf or leave the television on as background noise. Possibly because of the way that television is architected &#8212; itâs really easy to press the channel-up or channel-down button &#8212; I probably get a wider variety and range of perspectives than I do when Iâm on the Internet. For example, this week, Iâve watched at least of a few minutes of PBS, the three major American networks, the Discovery Channel, Fox News, and C-SPAN.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Radio/Music: I didnât listen to the radio this week. I usually listen to NPR if I drive, but I didnât drive this week. I used Songza (a website like Pandora that gives personalized music recommendations) to listen to music on my phone and computer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mobile</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A substantial amount of my media consumption is on my phone. Unfortunately, I didnât find a good tool to automatically track my mobile usage or automatically take screenshots; in hindsight, capturing my browsing history might have worked to some extent, but it wouldnât have been able to capture all of my usage through various apps. Itâs my hope that my deep dive into my desktop Internet usage will capture some of these patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A key exception is Facebook. A few weeks ago, to reduce distractions on my computer, I decided to logout of Facebook from my computer and access it only on my phone. I think that it has been a successful experiment &#8212; Iâve only logged in to Facebook on a couple of occasions. On my phone, I accessed Facebook on a daily basis and generally click on a few links on my news feed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Desktop/Internet</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">RescueTime</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a first step, I used RescueTime to measure my computer activity. As illustrated below, it provided an indication of when Iâm on the computer and the types of activities I do. It seems like a lot of my most productive hours are in the early evenings and early hours of the morning.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Usage by hour of day</p>

<p dir="ltr">Usage by category</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">RescueTime also provided a breakdown of my news and entertainment consumption:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MAhlXotFJx0-NSDtGCBS_l4W9lmQXY4nCMGPC-kmfOjrtJJG7358usJLoJMqBToNGbDVIxMb0pSN2asq9nkzQF15iMxPrI6ZdEleRtPs72Vn-NL_p42IFSt6cA" width="624px;" height="179px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">News consumption</p>

<p dir="ltr">Entertainment consumption</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reflections</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Iâm pretty surprised by how much I read Canadian media &#8212; I usually go to these URLs as a distraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">In contrast, I âstumble uponâ other kinds of physical offline media more often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Itâs interesting to think about how to think about and capture offline interactions and media consumption. The ways that I can think of, such as written or audio journaling or taking photos regularly, seem fairly disruptive and invasive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">It takes time and effort to trace oneâs own media consumption. Notably, large Internet companies &#8212; Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, and others &#8212; have substantial infrastructure and resources capturing every click and action of their users. It is interesting to think about what insights can be gleaned from that data, along with the limitations of what they can infer about human behavior and preferences.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left">For my data collection, I decided to use the application Rescue Time. Rescue Time is ideally used to enhance productivity and manage the amount of time spent on &#8216;disruptive&#8217; sites. The user can indicate a set of productivity goals with a set of sites that would be considered disruptive and calculate productivity on a daily basis based on media consumption.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Â I, on the other hand decided not to set any goals and just record my consumption based on sites visited. I do have to note that I have reservations regarding the pre-defined categories in the application, especially when Twitter and Facebook are considered disruptive sites. I find this problematic, not only because I use both platforms to conduct research, but also because I find that both sites can be valuable sources of information and news. Let alone the fact that other forms of media, such as daily interactions and talks are obviously not recorded and thus not represented in this data set. My other reservation is the fact that I can pause the application and stop recording any media I consume. I have to admit I used it on multiple occasions, which gives a skewed result of how many hours I was online and the media I consumed. Regardless, I found quite interesting results and patterns in the data set which I present below.</p>
<p>When I first thought of doing this assignment, I thought of creating a time lapse video of the sites I consumed using the data I collected from Rescue Time. Unfortunately, I face a number of hurdles, one being that the data collected was difficult to translate into a video. More importantly my search for a tool that would be able to create this time lapse proved futile. I tested out Popcorn Maker, (I recalled someone once explaining how easy it was to use, but also the ability to add comments to the videos) However, when I signed up and started using it I realized that I can only create a video from already published media on the web. Not wanting to duplicate some steps and publish material online to then use for a video, I decided to use iMovie, which I surprisingly had never used (Final Cut Pro was my program of choice.) As I started to compile images and graphs onto the program, only to realize that I couldn&#8217;t truly translate what I wanted to do with the data using this program.</p>
<p>I eventually, and for the sake of time decided to stick with an info-graph which you can find <a href="https://infogr.am/dalias-media-diary?src=web">HERE</a>. I used the site <a href="https://infogr.am">infogr.am</a> to create this graph, it is one of the many tools that are available on the web that can create info-graphics from raw data.</p>
<p>In addition to the info-graph I created, I decided to look into and present my daily consumption which varied from day to day, especially on the weekends.</p>

<p>What became a noticeable media pattern is that I was consuming more social media in the early morning and late night during the day.Â Whereas during the day I spent most of my time on e-mail, scheduling and &#8216;learning&#8217; sites.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I noticed that I had more time to catch up on the news. I have to admit as someone who considers themselves a news junkie, the fact that I spent so little time reading the news was shocking. Although, my news reading behavior has changed in recent years and I&#8217;ve started to rely more on social media as new source.</p>
<p>Having noted all those observations, I would still place a disclaimer and indicate that the data collected by Rescue Time is not entirely accurate and does not indicate time spent at talks, watching a film or media consumed on my phone.</p>

<p>I decided to present my media diary primarily as a short video highlighting the varied ways media reaches me. Watch it here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeeHQJxOCtg&amp;feature=youtu.be">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeeHQJxOCtg&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>This is in no way meant to be comprehensive, and in full disclosure it is a composite of two days.</p>
<p>Putting this together taught me a few key lessons:</p>
<p>* I&#8217;m nearly always consuming media &#8212; I was surprised by just how often. It depends on your definition of media, of course, but even when I was having a conversation with my wife or a friend, I noticed that there was often some form of media playing in the background (a TV in a restaurant, kids music at an indoor playground, etc.). And as you can see in the video I listen to podcasts on my iPhone whenever I&#8217;m walking, riding the T, or doing chores. So it&#8217;s rare that I go for more than half an hour without some kind of media input while I&#8217;m awake.</p>
<p>* Nearly all media I consume is digital, but I&#8217;m holding onto some print, mainly newspapers (<em>Boston Globe</em> and student newspapers) and a couple of magazines (the <em>New Yorker</em> and some cooking magazines). At times that creates awkward workflows, though. For instance, one day this week I picked up a <em>Harvard Crimson</em> when walking past a newspaper box in the law school, and I found an interesting story I wanted to share. So I opened my laptop, directed my browser to the <em>Harvard Crimson</em> online, then Tweeted the link to the story. Switching from print to an online version of the same article was a pain, but a couple of my followers retweeted it and it sparked a conversation with another journalist about the article, so I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m not in the habit of visiting the <em>Crimson</em> online, but I try to pick up the print paper while on campus because it&#8217;s nice to have the print to read while waiting for class to start. This incident made me realize that it would be easier if I just read the Crimson on my phone or laptop, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m headed in the future.</p>
<p>* I guess I&#8217;m addicted to podcasts.</p>
<p><strong>Content/Device Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>I did log my computer activity for several days using <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2013/05/30/problems-with-wikileaks-and-the-start-of-a-solution/" title="Problems with WikiLeaks and the Start of a Solution">RescueTime</a> to get a more-detailed sense of my consumption patterns. I also kept a diary manually with major types of activity, since I found that RescueTime sometimes misclassified my usage. Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>* On a typical day I use my laptop for between 5 and 6 hours.</p>
<p>* When on my laptop, my biggest activity is e-mail. I spend about 10 to 20 minutes per day on Twitter (via Hootsuite), and about 15 minutes on Facebook. I do make a point to go to a few newspaper sources throughout the day (The New York Times is my home page and I often check Google News). I&#8217;m sad to say I read DrudgeReport every day. </p>
<p>* I use my iPhone to entertain me whenever I&#8217;m by myself (this adds up to a couple of hours a day of usage). I either listen to podcasts, check my e-mail, check Facebook, or read an article on the phone. This realization makes me think of that recent <a href="http://teamcoco.com/video/louis-ck-springsteen-cell-phone">Louis CK rant.</a><br />
