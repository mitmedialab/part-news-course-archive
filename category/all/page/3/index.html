<p>Like many intergovernmental agencies or entities, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague is, generally speaking, little understood and even less valued in the United States.Â In the international community, the court is often either hailed as a remarkable development in international justice or starkly criticized as remote and ineffectual. Recent more damning criticisms dismissÂ the whole enterprise as Neocolonialist. But what actually can the court do and what has it done? This is a story that could be told in many ways involving deep historical and legal analysis. But it has also beenÂ a numbers game where location is deeply relevant and so I attempted to tell a very simple version of that story using maps made with Datawrapper. I am indebted to former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo and Harvard Kennedy School professor Kathryn Sikkink, whose January term HKS class &#8220;Preventing Mass Atrocities: Preventing Mass Atrocities: The Security Council and the International Criminal Court,&#8221; provided much of the background information.</p>
<p><strong>ROME STATUTEÂ </strong></p>
<p>In theÂ more than half century since the Nuremberg Trials, there have been a number of one-off experiments with international and local transitional justice (the international tribunals for theÂ former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Argentina, Guatemala etc.). But proponents of international justice dreamed of establishing a single court that would have jurisdiction to try grave cases of human rights abuses around the world and whose moral and legal authority would hopefully prevent such crimes from occurring in the future. After years of wrangling, the ICC was established by theÂ Rome Statute, which was adopted at an international diplomatic conference in 1998 and came into force in 2002.</p>
<p>There was of course a catch (several in fact) and limits on its authority and powers. The most significant being the court only has jurisdiction over those States that are parties to the statute (or committed crimes in territories that are parties). The exception to this rule is cases that have referred to the court by the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8AAGG/1/#?secret=80iQpOeBTq" data-secret="80iQpOeBTq" frameborder="0" width="584" height="389"></iframe></p>
<p>The above map and numbers of countries that have signed looks pretty impressive, until you realize who is missing &#8211; namely the United States, Russia, China and most of the countries of the Middle East. That&#8217;s more than half the UN Security Council and the countries where many of the worst conflicts of the 21st century are occurring.Â To some degree, the court merely holds a mirror to existing international power dynamics that govern our world. The ICC&#8217;s defenders would say it is unfair to expectÂ the court to surpass these realities. But for an entity whose stated mission includes preventing future atrocities from happening, the fact that no one responsible for the horrific crimes occurring in Syria is likely toÂ step foot in its chambers&#8211;unless there is a dramatic geopolitical shift&#8211;is a brutal blow.</p>
<p>Beyond jurisdiction, the court&#8217;s mandate only allows it to try cases that meet the threshold of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity or the less-tested crime of aggression. Â A case can only be prosecuted if it has been established that the appropriate State is unwilling or unable to genuinely do so itself.</p>
<p><strong>THE COURT&#8217;S RECORD</strong></p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Investigations</strong></p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wdPG5/1/#?secret=m0mEXWVCwv" data-secret="m0mEXWVCwv" frameborder="0" width="584" height="389"></iframe></p>
<p>Some of the cases that have undergone preliminary investigation test the third-party territorial jurisdiction clause (ie the United Kingdom for crimes committed in Iraq, the registered vessels of Comoros, Greece and Cambodia for the flotilla incident withÂ Israel)</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mC1fn/1/#?secret=3yraevXNuj" data-secret="3yraevXNuj" frameborder="0" width="584" height="389"></iframe></p>
<p>These are cases that are deemed not to meet the statutory requirements of the court.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qBuFl/2/#?secret=1aAkxUzCMb" data-secret="1aAkxUzCMb" frameborder="0" width="584" height="389"></iframe></p>
<p>These are cases that are ruled to meet the requirementsÂ for further investigation. Â This is where the geographic concentration of cases begins to become apparent.</p>
<p><b>Cases</b></p>

<p>The collapse of the court&#8217;s case in Kenya has been a source of much <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/magazine/international-criminal-court-moreno-ocampo-the-prosecutor-and-the-president.html?_r=0">concern</a> and seen as a bad omen for the court&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XZ5Vr/1/#?secret=UjZiqCdyY0" data-secret="UjZiqCdyY0" frameborder="0" width="584" height="389"></iframe></p>
<p>This includes noteworthy cases such as the Gadaffs in Libya (the case against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi for crimes committed during the Libyan revolution was dropped with his death, there is an arrest warrant out for his son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, but heÂ is being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-gaddafi-un-idUSKBN1600W8">held</a> by a militia in Libya), Â Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir (his arrest warrant, the first against an active head of State, has been routinely <a href="https://qz.com/630571/sudans-president-has-made-74-trips-across-the-world-in-the-seven-years-hes-been-wanted-for-war-crimes/">flouted</a> by African and Middle Eastern countries to which he he has travelled freely), and Joseph Kony in Uganda (the online video &#8220;Kony2012&#8221; may have been a viral sensation but has had no visible impact on securing his capture).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/S9f0I/1/#?secret=h3EIUT6tct" data-secret="h3EIUT6tct" frameborder="0" width="584" height="389"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These last maps should make apparent the main criticisms lodged against the court &#8211; that convictions have been few, that without a tool to enforce arrest warrants it will remain impotent and, most recently, that the pronounced focus on African countries is a sign of its colonialist intentions (and have resulted in the threat of the withdrawal of several African nations from the Rome Statute).</p>
<p>Proponents of the ICC mostly acknowledge that the court has its flaws that could be improved, but defend the cost and pace of the convictions by explaining the complexity, scope and ambition of what it trying to be achieved. They look to recent developments in Latin America as a sign that the court&#8217;s preventative potential may be working. The enforcement dilemma, they say, Â is ultimately one of political will that must be worked out through advocacy and diplomatic channels. And the charges of neocolonialism have been vehemently denied by the current Gambian and former Argentine prosecutors of the court, who <a href="http://www.justiceinfo.net/en/live-feed/30328-icc-bias-handy-cover-up-for-african-detractors-experts.html">argue</a> that those criticisms betray a lack of understanding of the court&#8217;s statutory limitations and are an excuse for brutal dictators to evade justice.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the ICC may be the best tool we have in an imperfect world. After all without it, former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo has asked, &#8220;who else will fight for the victims?&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing these discrepancies, we decided to dig deeper and try to understand what might account for the differences. Â We began by investigating how the data is collected and then comparing differing statistics between the two sources.</span></p>
<h1 style="font-size: 28px"><strong>EOPSSâ approach and its implications</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Massachusetts passed its first </span><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter22C/Section32"><span style="font-weight: 400">hate crime legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 1991, but not every agency has adhered to it. According to reports from the </span><a href="http://www.mass.gov/eopss/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Massachusett&#8217;s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the state did not begin tracking non-reporting agencies until 2005. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Massachusetts âHate Crimes Reporting Act </span><a href="http://www.mass.gov/eopss/hate-crimes-reporting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">requires that the number of hate crimes that occur in the Commonwealth be submitted to the Secretary of Public Safety annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, even if that number is zero. (M.G.L. c. 22C, Â§ 32).â Nonetheless, as late as 2014, some districts were not reporting this statistic. The FBI also compiles hate crime data, though submitting this information is voluntary. Some Massachusetts agencies that have failed to report hate crime data to the FBI have </span><a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2016/06/05/small-towns-massachusetts-fail-file-hate-crime-reports"><span style="font-weight: 400">stated they did not realize the FBI had even requested the information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The accuracy of hate crime reporting data can be influenced by a number of factors, including record keeping procedures within a given agencies and whether or not officers are trained to inquire about factors that qualify crimes as hate crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When agencies do not report data to the state, any hate crimes recorded in the populations in those districts are not represented by the official state statistics. Agencies that have zero hate crimes should report zero hate crimes to the state (These are designated as âzero-reportingâ agencies in official reports). A further complication in determining trends can occur when formerly non-reporting agencies begin to report incidents of hate crime if the number is not zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Data collected by Massachusetts indicates the population covered by agencies that did not report hate crime statistics grew from roughly 66,000 in 2011 to over 300,000 in 2014. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Massachusetts has recently taken steps to increase the publicâs ability to report hate crimes, </span><a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2016/11/14/mass-hotline-post-election-harassment"><span style="font-weight: 400">setting up a hotline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in November of 2016. Some police districts also have a </span><a href="http://www.mass.gov/eopss/docs/eops/hatecrimescivilrightsofficers.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">designated Civil Rights Officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to handle hate crimes. Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The issues raised by non-reporting are far from academic. When national tragedies occur, one reaction may be in an increase in hate crimes against particular populations. In these cases, hate crime statistics can provide insight about the implications for local communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, Bristol County Sheriff, Thomas Hodgson, </span><a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/bristol_county_sheriff_thomas_1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">called for the issue of arrest warrants for elected officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of âsanctuary cities.â This prompted Somerville mayor, Joe Curtatone, to </span><a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/03/come_and_get_me_massachusetts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">defend the legality of sanctuary cities and refer to Sheriff Hodgson as a âjack-booted thug.â</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> He further taunted Hodgson to, âcome and get me.â These flare ups between public officials indicate the tension that has formed in the public sphere around the issue of immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hate crime reporting statistics can provide a tool to measure claims of anti-immigrant-related incidents and provide the public with a sense of whether these incidents are on the rise. Massachusetts has responded to concerns about an increase in hate crimes by setting up a hate crime reporting hotline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Official statistics from police departments and college campuses can bring clarity to the issue, but Massachusetts must both require and enforce reporting mandates as well as provide training to local agencies to improve and standardize the reporting of these statistics.</span></p>
<h1 style="font-size: 28px"><strong>ADLâs selected approach and its implications</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another source of data on Massachusetts anti-Semitic crimes comes from the Jewish NGO, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The ADL was founded in the United States in 1913 and aims to âstop anti-Semitism and defend the Jewish people,â according to their website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since 1979, the ADL has conducted an annual âAudit of Anti-Semitic Incidents.â The ADLâs data partially overlaps with official data â they use data from law enforcement â but they also collect outside information from victims and community leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The limitations in the ADLâs audits are like those of any audits trying to cover anti-Semitic crimes. The </span><a href="https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/press-center/Audit-Methodology.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">way the ADL handles them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, however, should carefully be noted as it greatly affects the resulting numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, unlike the official data, the ADL also includes non-criminal acts of âharassment and intimidationâ in its numbers, which encompasses hate propaganda, threats, and slurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another key difference from the official data is that ADL staff attempt to verify all anti-Semitic acts included in the audit. While crimes against institutions are easier to confirm, harassment against individuals that are reported anonymously provide unique challenges for verifying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, some crimes are not easily identifiable as anti-Semitic even though they may be. In their annual audit, the ADL considers all types of vandalism at Jewish institutions to be anti-Semitic, even without explicit evidence of anti-Semitic intent. This includes stones thrown at synagogue windows, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, the ADL does not consider all swastikas to be anti-Semitic. As of 2009, they have stopped counting swastikas that donât target Jews, as it has become a universal symbol of hate in certain cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ADL also does not count related incidents separately. Instead, crimes or harassment that occurred in multiple nearby places at similar times are counted as one event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of these choices made by the ADL greatly affect the numbers that they produce each year.</span></p>
<h1 style="font-size: 28px"><strong>Comparing and contrasting the results of the two methodologies</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Numbers can tell different stories depending on the choices and circumstances surrounding the ADL and the EOPSSâ hate crime data collection processes. Â To demonstrate this, we compare some of the conclusions between the two datasets for anti-Semitic hate crimes in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Starting small: One location claim</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the ADLâs figures for 2013 indicated that </span><a href="http://newengland.adl.org/news/adl-audit-anti-semitic-incidents-increase-in-massachusetts-schools-are-hardest-hit/"><span style="font-weight: 400">28%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (or 13) of the 46 total anti-Semitic incidents that year took place on a school or college campus. Â If we look for the same percentage in the EOPSS data, we find a similar 29% of reported 2013 incidents occurring on a school or college campus. Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This single summary seems to bode well for comparisons between the two datasets: however, things get a little hazier when you look at the absolute numbers. Â Instead of 13 out of 46 total incidents, the EOPSS data reported 24 out of 83 incidents on a school or college campus, and itâs unclear what accounts for the difference in scale.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Time trends in reports</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we look at </span><a href="http://newengland.adl.org/news/adl-audit-anti-semitc-incidents-remain-steady-in-massachusetts-jewish-institutions-become-main-target/"><span style="font-weight: 400">time trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, 25% of the anti-Semitic incidents in Massachusetts reported by the ADL in 2014 occurred in July and August, while that figure was 8% for the same time period in 2013. Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That âmarked increaseâ in anti-Semitic incidents was attributed to the 50-day Israel-Gaza conflict that took place from July 8 to August 26, 2014 by ADL&#8217;s New England Regional Director saying, âThis yearâs audit provides an alarming snapshot into anti-Semitic acts connected to Operation Protective Edge over the summer as well as acts directed at Jewish institutions. Â The conflict last summer demonstrates how anti-Israel sentiment rapidly translates into attacks on Jewish institutions.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we look at EOPSS data for 2013 and 2014, however, there appears to be no sign of a marked increase in anti-Semitic incidents recorded in the summer months &#8212; in fact, in absolute numbers, both incidents in July/August and incidents in the entire year decreased from 2013 to 2014 in the EOPSS data. Â </span></p>
<p><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.03-PM.png" alt="" width="1338" height="388" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9512" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.03-PM.png 1338w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.03-PM-300x87.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.03-PM-768x223.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.03-PM-1024x297.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.03-PM-500x145.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1338px) 100vw, 1338px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because the ADL does not provide their underlying data to the public, we canât dig into the stories of the specific incidents in July/August 2014 and see if they could indeed be a result of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Â Additionally, with not-particularly-scientific or consistent reporting methodologies, itâs hard to make concrete conclusions from either of these datasets. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Incident types: Differences might be explained by differing reporting policies</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus far, weâve identified contradictions between the two datasets, but have not been able to discern how the two data collection methods may have specifically contributed to those contradictions. Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One topic where we can attempt to do so is the matter of vandalism: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the </span><a href="http://newengland.adl.org/news/adl-audit-anti-semitic-incidents-increase-in-massachusetts-schools-are-hardest-hit/"><span style="font-weight: 400">annual ADL audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, 16 of the 46 anti-Semitic incidents in Massachusetts in 2013 (35%) involved vandalism. Â The same figure from the ADL for </span><a href="http://newengland.adl.org/news/adl-audit-anti-semitc-incidents-remain-steady-in-massachusetts-jewish-institutions-become-main-target/"><span style="font-weight: 400">2014 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">was 23 vandalism incidents out of 47 total anti-Semitic incidents in Massachusetts (49%). Â In EOPSSâ numbers, however, vandalism looks like an even larger portion of anti-Semitic incidents in Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.24-PM.png" alt="" width="1324" height="388" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9513" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.24-PM.png 1324w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.24-PM-300x88.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.24-PM-768x225.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.24-PM-1024x300.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-10.02.24-PM-500x147.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As discussed previously, the ADL reports all vandalism of Jewish institutions as anti-Semitic incidents, but does not count all vandalism including swastikas as anti-Semitic incidents in their data. Â Although not directly specified, the EOPSS datasets likely do categorize all reports of swastikas as anti-Semitic vandalism, which would be a possible explanation for the large discrepancy in percentages (on top of the simple explanation that with numbers of this magnitude and lack of precision, variations are inevitable).</span></p>
<h1 style="font-size: 28px"><strong>Do Data Due-Diligence!</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Investigating the discrepancies and the data collection methodologies was not merely an academic exercise: it demonstrates that this is a necessary step to understanding what kinds of conclusions you can reasonably draw from your data and what kinds of caveats you should include when reporting or making decisions based on that data. Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using only one dataset without exploring how the data was collected and digging into the details of the data could yield very different headlines:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blindly using ADL data might yield: â</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anti-Semitic hate crimes in Massachusetts increase 2% from 2013 to 2014.â</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400">(This was just 46 to 47 â is it really reflective of the situation to call that a 2% increase? Does this reflect the reality?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blindly using EOPSS data might yield: â</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Massachusetts became safer for Jewish people in 2014: anti-Semitic hate crimes dropped 43% from 2013.â</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400">Â (Is this message true, or is this âtrendâ due to data collection issues? Why does it paint such a different picture from the ADL data?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do your data due-diligence.</span></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last November, Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders raised some eyebrows when he said, &#8220;&#8230;climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. If we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, youâre gonna see countries all over the world â this is what the CIA says â theyâre going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and youâre going to see all kinds of international conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, a number of media outlets have fact-checked this statement, and PolitiFact has rated this comment as being Mostly False. You can read about PolitiFact&#8217;s full analysis <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/16/bernie-s/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-comments-climate-chan/">here</a>.</p>
<p>While Sanders&#8217;s comments were perhaps too direct in establishing a causality relationship between climate change and terrorism, he&#8217;s not alone in connecting the impact of climate change as a destabilizing force that terrorist organizations can take advantage of. The Defense Department mentions climate change as a &#8220;threat multiplier&#8221; in a 2014 report, and Al Gore has been <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/brexit-climate-change-al-gore-says-global-warming-syria-war-helped-leave-vote-a7645866.html">quoted</a> numerous timesÂ how the Syrian Civil War was caused by extreme drought conditions, which were caused by climate change.</p>
<p>While intuitively, these arguments make logical sense, other than anecdotal one-off instances (i.e. drought in Syria led to Syrian Civil War, drought in Nigeria led to Boko Haram, etc.), what has lacked is a comprehensive review of extreme weather conditions globally in recent years, and whether geographies facing the worst impact of climate change has seen an increase in terrorist activities. Based on Sanders&#8217;s statements, this seems like a reasonable assumption to make.</p>
<p>The first place to look was at where climate change was hitting the hardest in recent history. Mapped below is a heatmap of the impact of extreme weather events on the population. The higher number, the great percentage of the population that has been impacted by extreme weather such as drought, floods, etc.</p>
<div id="attachment_9460" style="width: 1281px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9460" class="wp-image-9460 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-12.31.19-PM.png" alt="" width="1271" height="761" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-12.31.19-PM.png 1271w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-12.31.19-PM-300x180.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-12.31.19-PM-768x460.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-12.31.19-PM-1024x613.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-11-at-12.31.19-PM-500x300.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1271px) 100vw, 1271px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9460" class="wp-caption-text">Data source: IMF. Extreme weather impact on percentage of population, 1990-2009</p></div>
<p>An interactive version of the map is here:Â https://public.tableau.com/profile/publish/Apr11/Story1#!/publish-confirm</p>
<p>Swaziland, Malawi, China, Niger, and Eritrea are countries who have populations most impacted by severe weather conditions. If Sanders&#8217;s comments hold true, we should also see the highest number of terrorist activities in those countries in recent history. Mapped below is the number of casualties from terrorist incidents since 1980.Â Casualties were plotted here instead of number of incidents to show the severity of terrorist activity.</p>
<p>https://public.tableau.com/views/Terrorismvs_GDP/Dashboard1?:embed=y&#038;:display_count=yes</p>
<p>ItÂ is immediately apparent that those 5 countries do not have anywhere near the highest number of terrorist casualties in the past two to three decades.</p>
<p>Also included in the interactive map for context is the percentage change in GDP year over year to potentially show the amplifier impact of climate change, as well as poor economic conditions on terrorist activity. However, based on the data that is presented, no direct relationship can be easily seen between both climate change, and economic health on terrorist activity. Sanders&#8217;s comments don&#8217;t hold up againstÂ the data. Instead, as <a href="http://time.com/4113801/climate-change-terrorism/">Time</a> and PolitiFact have indicated, there seems to be many other factors that contribute towards terrorist incidents.</p>

			<p>This was a really long process! I explored debunking a number of widespread beliefs/myths&#8211;environmental legislation costs jobs, people in the US pay the highest taxes, access to family planning increases abortion. The answer to most of these, was not in a single fact that was true or false, but in a framework of beliefs and approaches to viewing the world that foster the acceptance of particular arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental legislation and regulation: It&#8217;s complicated&#8211;but not really.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Upshot:Â </strong>The majority of new jobs in the energy sector domestically and internationally will be renewable energy jobsÂ and related support services, but there will be and are &#8220;losers&#8221; (i.e., coal industry miners and related support services).Â <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/california-governor-signs-ambitious-renewable-energy-bill-into-law-255adbb6a378#.8f3oay2nx">Pro-environment legislation</a> and <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables/">state subsidies to businesses and private citizens in states like California</a> have created a booming renewable energy market and spurred technological innovation. States like Ohio and West Virginia, which have <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2016/11/ohio_lawmakers_try_again_to_we_1.html">actively resisted moves toward renewable energy</a> are not well-positioned to take advantage of emerging production or related support jobs in this sector. Renewable energy and related jobs will be global economic drivers regardless of whether or not the Unites States chooses to participate. Other countries have made independent decisions regarding their energy futures and chosen to pursue renewables. Independent, publicly-funded research and policy making efforts attempt to analyze complex issues in a non-partisan manner, but the media (and research) ecosystem is pervaded by partisan think tanks, private money, and even foreign dollars. These factors undermine the credibility of sources of information and correspondingly public trust in those sources.</p>
<p><strong>Why so complicated?Â </strong></p>
<p>1. Energy <strong><em>is</em></strong> actually complicated &#8211; Energy use and production affects individuals, businesses, corporations, and governments&#8211;each with competing and sometimes overlapping interests.</p>
<p>2. Â <strong><em>Poor-quality or biased [mis]information </em></strong><em>&#8211;Â </em>A decrease in <strong>publicly-funded</strong> science and <strong>non-partisan</strong> governmental organizations resulting in <strong>less transparent, less reliable</strong> sources of information. Prior to neoliberal globalization, government agencies, universities, and think tanks were much less affected by corporate interests and lobbying (see <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674046467">Science-Mart</a> for a particularly in-depth treatment of the topic).</p>
<p>The energy sector is an appropriate case study of a phenomenon that has occurred in other previously public areas (i.e., education).</p>
<p>Both renewable and fossil energy lobbying groups and think tanks have a strong presence. These groups are motivated to generate research and studies supporting their economic aims. When the organization is private, the public cannot access records of financial contributions and identify donors. This undermines transparency and credibility.</p>
<p>Domestically, [political, social, economic] a variety of actorsÂ have invested themselves in the creation of a research and development framework that favors private, corporate interests over the public good and civic society.</p>
<p>TheÂ <a href="http://www.thinktankwatch.com/">Think Tank Watch</a>Â project at the University of Pennsylvania classifies and tracks think tank activity. The think tank picture is further complicated as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html">foreign governments buy influence in American think tanks</a>.</p>

<p>An energy-related project,Â <a href="http://www.thinktankmap.org/Default.aspx?Search=Yes">Think Tank Map</a>,Â tracks think tanks that conduct climate-related research. <a href="https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/">The Buckeye Institute</a>Â is a conservative, pro-fossil fuel private organization with an annual budget of 2.7 million dollars.Â Members of its <a href="https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/about/type/board">Board of Trustees</a> have ties to the fossil fuel and plastics industries. This organization <a href="https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/research/type/policy-research-and-reports">generates reports</a>Â that would fail to meet basic academic standard as objective research. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with lobbying for policy, but to do so under the guise of an &#8220;independent think tank&#8221; misrepresents the mission of the organizationÂ <strong>andÂ </strong>undermines the work of independent, publicly-funded think tanks. Pro-renewable think tanks and lobbyists further cloud the picture with reports that lobby for their interests.</p>

<p>Taxpayers have invested in their own futures and the success of businesses by funding the underlying physical (i.e., highways) and virtual (i.e., the internet) infrastructure upon which corporations rely. Independent and transparent research and organizations are critical to the continuation of cycle of success.</p>

			<p>Stereotypes about womenâs tasks and (lack of certain) skills are very dominant in Serbia. These prejudices and sexist believes are often supported by women themselves, as if they gain power by agreeing with common views and menâs perspectives. My goal is to write a short and simple way of arguing the opposite and perhaps offering an alternative narrative that hopefully could be accepted without seeming âthreateningâ to the existing manhood mentality. In specific I focused on debunking the myth that women are inherently bad drivers.<a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DijanaM-Truth-and-Truthiness.pdf">DijanaM Truth and Truthiness</a></p>

<p>Comments about the assignment:</p>
<p>Wowâwhat a challenging assignment! At first I considered everything from promoting 1-year federally funded maternity/paternity leave to increasing science funding for medical applications of psychedelics. Â Then I started off trying to argue queer-inclusive sex ed and realized that I could only argue that to people already on board with safe sex-oriented sex ed in the first place. For those people, who are likely also to support queer rights, making sex ed queer-inclusive is likely more an awareness issue than a disputed issue.</p>
<p>So I landed on arguing for sex ed oriented around safe sex practices. I wanted to build a case around randomized controlled trials measuring the effectiveness on metrics like teen pregnancy and STI rates of abstinence-only programs vs. safe sex programs, and it turned out that either the data I wanted does not exist or is hard to come by.Â It is hard forÂ studies to measure anything beyond self-reported sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Next, without the quantitative numbers to make a good argument, I wanted to make a rational argument for why sex ed should focus on safe sex practices. However, I felt like my rational arguments relied on value judgments that a conservative audience would not share. In the end I ended up using an appeal to authority, having read that 70% of Republicans do in fact trust the CDC as an organization.</p>

			<p>I visited the new Facebook campus in Menlo Park, California last week. As everybody, I could be anything but impressed: the building is 430,000-square-foot, it is the largest open-workspace in the world, and was designed by Franck Ghery, who also designed Los Angelesâ Disney Concert Hall. The various activities offered (room dedicated for video games, nap area, for instance) and the wide range of food options encountered at every corner (hamburgers, coffee place, ice cream place, hot dogs stands, etc.) &#8211; definitely gives the wanderer the illusion to be in an attraction park more than in a working space.</p>
<p>Last year, employees on Glassdoor have voted Facebook the No. 1 company to work for overall. Even if Facebook has often been regarded as one of the best places to work in the tech industry, this article is meant to show that this model presents many downsides.</p>
<p><strong><em>The reviews of the employees are actually very mixed</em></strong>, as it is shown:</p>
<p>https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Facebook/reviews</p>
<p><strong><em>The Facebook campus model does enable any work-life balance</em></strong></p>
<p>The Facebook campus is opened 24/7, and offers food all day long and nap areas to its employees<strong><em>. </em></strong>Some Employees admit that they tend to stay longer to work. A few are even sleeping at the office, and do not eat at home anymore</p>
<p><strong><em>And employees have to stay connected all the time</em></strong></p>
<p>âFor six weeks out of the year, I&#8217;m on 24/7 on-call dutyâ; âYou can never really leave work, even when you&#8217;re on vacationâ; âUngodly amounts of email from internal communications, 1,600 or more a dayâ; &#8220;At most companies, you put up a wall between a work personality and a personal one, which ends up with a professional workspace. The wall does not exist at Facebook&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/technology/10-employees-talk-about-working-at-facebook-and-it-doesn-t-sound-all-that-pretty-252275.html">http://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/technology/10-employees-talk-about-working-at-facebook-and-it-doesn-t-sound-all-that-pretty-252275.html</a></p>
<p><strong><em>The firm culture can also be called into question</em></strong></p>
<p>âA large company trying to act like a young oneâ; âI&#8217;ve seen decisions being made by internsâ; âLooking too hard at Googleâ; âWorking for Facebook sometimes means wasting a lot of time browsing Facebookâ</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-22-worst-things-about-working-at-facebook-according-to-employees-2015-7/#ck-and-sheryl-imposing-a-holier-than-thou-attitude-13">http://www.businessinsider.com/the-22-worst-things-about-working-at-facebook-according-to-employees-2015-7/#ck-and-sheryl-imposing-a-holier-than-thou-attitude-13</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Even if they benefit of many free services, their life-style is not as healthy as it used to be: </em></strong></p>
<p>Using free bikes and the gym available on the campus replace the usual weekly exercise. However, most of the employees admit that going to the gym is not part of their regular schedule anymore, and that do not go as often as they used to before joining Facebook. Also, with free food and free snacks often in all the buildings, and at every floor, most of them start gaining weight as soon as they join the firm.</p>
<p><strong><em>Facebook is accelerating the gentrification of Silicon Valley</em></strong></p>
<p>Facebook offered employees 10,000$ to live close to the office, and âa lot of local families are going to get hurtâ â</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/18/facebook-offers-employees-10000-to-live-close-to-the-office">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/18/facebook-offers-employees-10000-to-live-close-to-the-office</a></p>
<p><strong><em>The relationships between colleagues are altered</em></strong></p>
<p>Facebook Employees have to become âFacebook friendsâ with their colleagues. Do your colleagues always have to be your friends? Some admits that looking the pictures posted daily by colleagues alter the image they have of them and their working relationship</p>
<p><strong><em>The company does not manage its own growth well</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2010, Facebook has 1,700 employees. In 2016, it has 11,996, and critics are raised about Facebookâs quick scale up, and inability to keep its start-up culture</p>

			<p>There recently has been a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/14/14921962/ahca-mortality-gun-homicides">flurry</a> of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/23/repealing-the-affordable-care-act-will-kill-more-than-43000-people-annually/?utm_term=.d7a0a544f76f">declarations</a> by Democratic politicians, scholars, and pundits that the bill replacing of Obamacare is literally deadly. This is a pretty potent argument, and an especially shocking one, as it essentially accuses Republicans to willfully kill Americans.</p>
<p>I want to stop on one of these statements. In January, Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/819590552576491520">said on Twitter</a> that the Obamacare replacement would kill 36,000 people. He was promptly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/14/bernie-sanderss-claim-that-36000-people-will-die-yearly-if-obamacare-is-repealed/?utm_term=.3dba5c016f0a">rebuked</a> by the Washington Post, which considered his declaration nonsensical, partially because the details of the Obamacare repeal law were not known at the time. Now that the bills are on the table, and given the additional similar declarations by other Democrats, I figured it would useful to re-check that claim today, and see if it is still worthy of a rebuttal.</p>
<p>In short, the overall direction of that statement may be true, but the number truly is baseless. There is no proper study to back up that precise number. Indeed, no study provided a precise answer as to how many deaths would result from a repeal law. Unsurprisingly, Democrats have put forward wildly different numbers than just 36,000.</p>
<p>The numbers put forward by Democrats are generally recycled from two health policy studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1202099#t=abstract">first one</a> looks at how the mortality rate evolved in states that expanded Medicaid in the early 2000s vis-Ã -vis the ones who didn&#8217;t. They found that it saved one life for every 455 newly-insured people; extrapolating that to 20 million insurance losses, you find 44,000 deaths annually.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://annals.org/aim/article/1867050/changes-mortality-after-massachusetts-health-care-reform-quasi-experimental-study">second one</a> looks at how the rate evolved in Massachusetts after the passage of &#8216;Romneycare&#8217;, which was an Obamacare-like system in that state. They found that it saved one life for every 830 newly-insured adults. This translates to 24,000 or 36,000 deaths nationally if you estimate, respectively, that the law will make 20 or 30 million Americans lose health insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 36,000 number that Sanders quoted came probably from the conclusion of the second study, as well as an extrapolation based on 30 million health insurance losses. The Washington Post was right when asserting that Sanders couldn&#8217;t know how many people would lose health insurance because of the Obamacare repeal, indeed, he was off by 5 to 8 millions. So, even if we apply Sanders&#8217; methodology to the death question, we would find something in the range of 30,000 people.</p>
<p>But even applying Sanders&#8217; methodology is problematic. Translating these studies&#8217; finding to an Obamacare repeal is not easy and amounts a little to compare apples to oranges. The obvious caveat is that the two studies are heavily local, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-05-06/obamacare-might-help-you-live-longer">especially in Massachusetts</a>, which has much better care and much more wealth than other states. Therefore, it is unclear how much the results in one American region can be scaled to the entire country. More largely, it highlights a thorny problem when it comes to the evaluation of an Obamacare repeal: how many (healthy) people would happily choose to drop their insurance, how many would do it because they can&#8217;t afford it, and how many would do it because of both? This is rendered all the more complicated by the relative leakiness of the Obamacare mandate, which may mean that the healthy people who would drop health insurance after a repeal have already done it.</p>
<p>More notably, the repeal of Obamacare is not a full repeal. For instance, the bills keep the Obamacare structure, with its private healthcare markets, in place. They also change the distribution of the health insurance subsidies, potentially altering the composition of the Americans with health insurance. This mean that, even if we could estimate the numbers of lives spared by Obamacare, it is not possible to consider that it would be the numbers of lives taken by an Obamacare repeal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the assertion that the Republican bills will kill people is essentially speculative, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/24/us-healthcare-republican-bill-no-coverage-death">it probably is right</a>. It is overwhelmingly likely that, if Republicans are able to repeal and/or replace Obamacare, millions more people will be uninsured in the medium-run, and a lack of health insurance is correlated to mortality.</p>
<p>But to advance a precise number is unjustified. It is unclear how much the population that would forego health insurance would be particularly prone to getting sick. Moreover, the studies that have estimated how many lives were spared by the extension of health insurance in other contexts display varying numbers. Now, all these caveats only make the estimate less reliable. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the number is necessarily going to be smaller. However, the level of assertiveness of some Democrats with regard to these death estimates is simply not warranted.</p>
