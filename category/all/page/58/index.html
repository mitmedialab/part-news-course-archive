			<p>Lawrence Lessig sees the American people, enthroned as sovereign of the nation by the United States Constitution, as a sleeping giant. It&#8217;s OK to sleep; in general, we&#8217;d all rather focus on things other than politics. But there are times when our political system is so broken, we must awaken and flex the powers granted to us by our Constitution. Lessig argues that now is one of those times.</p>
<p><a href="https://partnews.mit.edu/category/all/page/58/republic.lessig.org"><img style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial;float: right;width: 300px;height: 453px;margin: 5px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/republic_large.jpg" alt="Republic, Lost" /></a></p>
<p>The first event in the spring <a href="http://media.mit.edu/events/conversations">Media Lab Conversations Series</a> featured a conversation between Media Lab Director Joi Ito and lawyer, professor, author, and reformer Lawrence Lessig. Joi and Larry met in Japan in 2002, and their paths crossed a number of times over the following years as each took on campaigns <a href="http://creativecommons.org">for creative culture</a> and <a href="http://rootstrikers.org">against state corruption</a>.</p>
<p>Lessig most recently shifted to focus entirely on <a href="http://republic.lessig.org/">fighting corruption</a>, despite his fame in intellectual property. He begins his talk with an apology for distracting us from our research. In an ideal world, he says, it&#8217;d be absurd for us to sit and listen to him. What&#8217;s happening here at the Media Lab is some of the most inspiring, creative work there is, and it&#8217;s absurd we should have to take time away from these pursuits to listen to a talk about politics.</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s here to recruit us, to distract us from our machines for a moment, because it&#8217;s critical that people like us pay attention and contribute to the solution of an extraordinary problem. Every 100 years or so, society finds itself at a point where even the geniuses are forced to confront the messy world of politics. In Europe, the physicists working on atomic power and other wonders had to stop their work and confront fascism. Lessig says we&#8217;re at a similar place now, where the scientists must look up from our pure research and take action.</p>
<p><strong>Rootstrikers</strong><br />
Lessig leads with this Thoreau quote that inspired the name of his <a href="http://rootstrikers.org/">Rootstrikers</a> campaign:<br />
&#8220;<em>There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Even further back in time, Benjamin Franklin wrote a clause outlawing gifts to officials, with fear of a potential dependency between the officials and the gift-givers.</p>
<p>Yet in July of last year, Rasmussen reported that 46% of Americans believe Congress is corrupt. The institution isn&#8217;t filled with Rod Blagojeviches. It&#8217;s filled with people who came to Washington for a public purpose. Nixon said he wasn&#8217;t a crook, and so does Congress.</p>
<p>The framers of the Constitution gave us a republic, by which they meant a representative democracy, with a branch of government dependent upon the people alone. The model described in the Constitution places the people as the marionette, pulling the strings of Congress.</p>
<p>And yet it&#8217;s the campaign funders pulling the strings. Members of Congress spend between 30-70% of their time raising money to get back into Congress, or to get their party back in power. They develop a sixth sense, as any of us would, of what will raise money, not on important issues 1 through 10, but on issues 11 through 1,000, where a questionable position will draw less attention.</p>
<p><strong>The Funders are Not the People</strong><br />
0.26% of Americans donate to political campaigns<br />
0.05% max out their FEC limit<br />
0.0000063% of Americans gave 80% of the SuperPAC money so far in this election.</p>
<p>This is corruption. It&#8217;s not the corruption of cash in brown paper bags, or of Rod Blagojevich selling access. It&#8217;s corruption of dependence, and a corruption of the framers&#8217; intent that the Congress be dependent on the people.</p>
<p>Political scientists have trouble estimating the effect of money on policy, which people like former FEC <a href="http://www.fec.gov/members/former_members/smith/smith.shtml">Commissioner Brad Smith</a> spin to suggest that there is no evidence of corruption. A lack of evidence does not suggest an absence of evidence, however.</p>
<p>Ask the public. Across party lines, Americans believe that money buys results in Congress (71-81%). ABC has recently found that 9% of Americans approve of Congress. More Americans supported the British Crown at the time of the American Revolution.</p>
<p>Rock the Vote has found that youth voting rates in 2010 were deflated by the expectation that a vote isn&#8217;t enough to make a difference in a corrupt system. The same reason is given by voters of all age groups. Regardless of the issue, from healthcare to global warming to financial reform, reform is essential. The system of government where the funders control Congress will systematically block change as long as it&#8217;s in place.</p>
<p>Lessig knows what rational creatures he&#8217;s speaking to at MIT. He beseeches us to realize that our current political system will block reason within the halls of Congress, no matter the issue. We are the 1% of people whose very occupation is the pursuit of reason, and we get to spend all day finding the right answer. When you recognize the privilege of living life in terms of doing what makes sense, and realize that our government never gets to ask that question, &#8220;What makes sense?&#8221;, you realize the responsibility you have to change the system.</p>
<p>Congress is fundamentally corrupt and they are responsible for that corruption.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>If the problem is systemic, and not just a matter of some corrupt people, then the solution is to give Congress a way to fund their campaigns without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust">Faust</a>. They need a way to behave that doesn&#8217;t involve selling the country&#8217;s future each financial quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen Funded Campaigns</strong><br />
Should citizens fund our campaigns? Or should foreign nationals and corporations fund our campaigns? The Constitution is pretty clear about how it feels about the latter arrangement.</p>
<p>As of now, a miniscule percentage of Americans privately funds our campaigns. While the framers of our Constitution worked extremely hard to make all voters equal on Election Day, our current system allows the tiniest slice of the wealthiest among us to gain the most influence.</p>
<p>One alternative is government-funded elections, where the government dispenses funds. But people complain that their money is used to subsidize speech they don&#8217;t believe in. And, like other government funding systems, it becomes bloated.</p>
<p>Lessig proposes a mix between private and government funding. It&#8217;s a mix we see in some states, where small donations are amplified by public matching funds. Arizona, Maine, and Connecticut have such systems in place.</p>
<p>In 2010, the House came close to passing the <a href="http://fairelectionsnow.org/">Fair Elections Now Act</a>. Lessig proposes what he calls the Grant &amp; Franklin plan. It&#8217;s based on the fact that each of us contributes at least $50 (the bill featuring Ulysses S. Grant) to the federal treasury. If we rebated that $50 in form of a democracy voucher, candidates could run entirely on these funds. We could match democracy vouchers with another $50 (making it $100, featuring Benjamin Franklin).</p>
<p>This would amount to a campaign funding system funded with $7 billion, multiple times the $1.8 billion spent in private donations in 2010. Such a plan would remove a source of incessant cynicism.</p>
<p><strong>Would that be enough, given the SuperPACs out there?</strong><br />
No. We&#8217;ve entered the age of the SuperPAC, with the Tony Soprano model of influence. Evan Bayh, retired Senator from Indiana, described the impact of the Citizens United case:</p>
<p>Every incumbent is now terrified that, 30 days before their election, some Super PAC will come in and drop millions of dollars in advertising against them.</p>
<p>Candidates feel that they need some form of Super PAC insurance, so that when a (money) bomb is dropped on one side, another (money) bomb gets dropped to neutralize it. You get insurance by paying premiums in advance. Super PACs have succeeded in aligning votes with mere promises of insurance &#8211; they actually call members of Congress with scripts saying things like &#8220;We need you to support us 80% of the time for us to support you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A plan like Lessig&#8217;s wouldn&#8217;t ban independent political expenditures, but it would limit them within 90 days of an election. If we had these two features, it&#8217;d make trust in our institutions possible again.</p>
<p>But is all of this possible? It&#8217;s easy to see a problem, and not so difficult to see a solution, but can be quite difficult to enact a solution.</p>
<p>Congressman Jim Cooper, of Tennessee, described Capitol Hill as &#8220;a farm league for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Street_(street)">K Street</a>.&#8221; Many in Congress are focused on their lives after government, as lobbyists. Fifty percent of the Senate and forty-two percent of the House left to become lobbyists and cash in on their contacts and experience.</p>
<p><strong>Insiders vs. Outsiders</strong><br />
<img style="float: right;width: 155px;height: 225px;border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;margin: 3px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/OneWayForward_Byliner.jpeg" alt="One Way Forward, by Lawrence Lessig" />Lessig just published <a href="http://byliner.com/originals/one-way-forward">One Way Forward</a> to chart the course ahead. He sees the primary divide in American politics not between left and right, but between inside and outside. Outsiders have become so disgusted with how things are, they&#8217;ve put aside their lives for a moment to try and find an answer. The year 1998 saw Americans rally behind MoveOn.org. In 2009, the Tea Party took the spotlight, followed by Occupy in 2011.</p>
<p>These waves are building over time. The challenge, Lessig argues, is for these waves to have some awareness of their combined potential, of their latent power. Right now, they&#8217;re extremely passionate, but also polarized. We should look at each of these waves and see the cross-partisan potential they have to move and act together, even if right now there&#8217;s very low recognition of that potential. That&#8217;s what we need to change.</p>
<p>This giant &#8212; the people &#8212; is sleeping most of the time. It must be awakened. Think of the Allied Forces against Naziism. We must stand on common ground, not because we have a common end, but to recognize the common enemy of corruption.</p>
<p>Lessig doesn&#8217;t try to predict the complete arch of this movement. But we do need to engage more ordinary citizens in the practice of teaching. <a href="http://Rootstrikers.org">Rootstrikers.org</a> is recruiting citizens who will teach fellow citizens about the connection between the things they care about and the root of it, corruption. If Thoreau&#8217;s math found that there are 1,000 striking at the branches for every 1 hitting the root, we&#8217;ll need 311,000 teachers for all 3.11 million Americans. That&#8217;s their goal.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s corruption happening around the world, and around the world, people are rising up in fury against it. Starting this week, Lessig&#8217;s asking people to pledge to end corruption, and to specify how they&#8217;ll do so. The branding resembles the various Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p><strong>We Are All Enablers</strong><br />
<img style="float: right;width: 250px;height: 329px;border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;margin: 3px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/time.jpg" alt="Exxon Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood" />Lessig plays the audio from the Exxon Valdez&#8217;s return transmission alerting the dispatcher of the collision and ensuing oil leak. It&#8217;s clear to everyone listening that the pilot is intoxicated. The captain escaped conviction, but there&#8217;s little doubt to observers that he was drunk.</p>
<p>There was no doubt, however, that he had a problem with alcohol. His own mother testified, and there are records of his license being revoked for DUIs. At the time he capsized a supertanker, he was not allowed to drive a VW Beetle on the highway. But consider everyone else around him: all the people who did nothing while a drunk was driving a supertanker. We are those people.</p>
<p>We have many problems today. And yet our institutions are distracted, too busy to focus. And so are we, too busy doing the real work that produces value and contributes to the world, too busy to focus on this critical problem and give it the serious attention it needs. So who&#8217;s to blame?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too easy to point to the evil people. They have their share of responsibility. It&#8217;s the good people, the decent people, the most privileged, who have the obligation to fix this. Corruption is permitted by the passivity of the privileged.</p>
<p>A republic depends on the people alone. We have lost our republic, and it&#8217;s time for all of us to act to get it back.</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong><br />
Joi points out that the Media Lab is focused on future impact, but also on building stuff that will be immediately useful, as with the <a href="http://civic.mit.edu">Center for Civic Media</a>. With <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses, Lessig built a technical solution that scaled one solution to the widespread problem of traditional copyright&#8217;s chokehold. Yet with reform, Lessig&#8217;s been writing books and giving talks. What&#8217;s the scaleable solution?</p>
<p>&#8220;I discover a new limit almost every single day,&#8221; Lessig admits. He sees his role as seeding ideas and infecting communities to leverage their own recognition to solve the problem. We can&#8217;t choose not to engage in the political system. There are hugely important problems, that, unless the government engages in a serious way, are going to screw us. He admits that it&#8217;s enormously frustrating to be researching at the coolest place in the world and be told you need to divert your attention to get America to fix its government&#8230;but it&#8217;s what we need to do.</p>
<p><strong>Ian Condry asks how we can better model participatory democracy.</strong><br />
Lessig sees a realistic democracy as one where things basically function, and citizens can sleep most of the time, and pay attention when things break down. Things have broken down. It&#8217;s completely rational to be ignorant about government right now, because it gives you frustration, and you&#8217;d rather spend time with your kids. If we can change the system to give us some faith that democracy is functioning, more people would participate.</p>
<p>People look back to our founding and say, &#8220;They were all basically the same white guy.&#8221; But we forget: they were radically different people. There were people in that room who believed in slavery, and people who believed that slavery was the moral abomination of the age. They were able to bracket that debate long enough to produce a constitution. We don&#8217;t have to draft a constitution &#8212; we just have to tweak it a small bit.</p>
<p><strong>How do you actually get the Constitution amended in this environment?</strong><br />
The Constitution provides two paths: Congress proposes an Amendment (every existing Amendment has been ratified this way). Or, if it turns out that Congress itself is the problem, the Constitution allows for a constitutional convention to be held by the states. This almost occurred when Americans were organizing to force elections for Senate seats, but Congress stopped the convention movement by caving to the demands for an elected Senate. Lessig&#8217;s OK with organizing a convention movement to the point that Congress must give into the pressure to diffuse it.</p>
<p>Asked about the likelihood of achieving such reform, Lessig asks us to imagine a doctor has just told you that your son has terminal brain cancer. Would you do nothing? Or, would you fight like hell, despite the odds, to do everything possible? When you love something, you fight regardless of rationality. Patriotism is a useful motivator here. We need to find a way to motivate people to act, even assuming it&#8217;s impossible, because we have no choice. We can&#8217;t being to address the problems we need to address unless we do. You&#8217;re only a citizen? That&#8217;s all we need. Only a citizen.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the role for the coders of America?</strong><br />
They can enable an infrastructure to rally and organize people effectively to surpass the power on the other side. This is a problem we can only fix in this period of technological transition. The 20th century model of informing and directing people is currently broken, and we can take advantage of this fact. If you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Leonhardt-t.html?pagewanted=all">Tim Wu</a>, you think the current system will soon be co-opted by the powers that be. But even if he&#8217;s correct, we have five years before that mold is set. We need more and better tools to topple corruption. So yeah, we need code, the right kind of code, code that thinks about waking the giant up and helping the giant recognize that it has a left and a right hand, and has to learn how to walk, and has to act in a rational way, not just crazy, as waking giants frequently act when they first wake up [think French Revolution].</p>
<p>With regards to visualizing networks and data, Lessig recommends <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Super-Crunchers-Thinking-Numbers-Smart/dp/0739354728">Super Crunchers</a>.</p>
<p>Asked about transparency, Lessig critiques &#8220;<a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/against-transparency">naked transparency</a>,&#8221; where people believe that transparency alone will lead to change. Of course we want to see the bad stuff that&#8217;s happening, but we also want to stop the bad stuff from happening. If you only achieve the former, you actually dissuade more people from having anything to do with politics.</p>
<p>Christopher Fry argues, &#8220;You need people in the government who are well motivated, and you need a good process for them to follow. If you don&#8217;t have both, you won&#8217;t succeed. We have neither in DC right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lessig responds that there isn&#8217;t just one problem to fix. There are forty. We&#8217;re filtering for a special kind of person when we consider the amount of work required to fundraise at the amounts they&#8217;re fundraising at. Is that the sort of person you want at the lever? But when you&#8217;re dealing with an alcoholic, you need to solve the alcoholism first. Pick your issue. We will not solve it under this system. Global warming. Healthcare. Broadband. Reagan passed the biggest reform of US tax code through Congress by striking a deal with Tip O&#8217;Neill and the Democrats in an environment that&#8217;s entirely unfathomable today.</p>

<p>“Super” political action committees, or super PACs, have been changing the face of the 2012 election.  These PACs often raise more money than the candidates themselves, and are funded by wealthy repeat donors.  <a href="http://www.restoreourfuture.com">Restore Our Future</a>, the super PAC associated with Mitt Romney, <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php">has raised over 30 million dollars for this election cycle</a>.</p>
<p>It’s in this world that Lawrence Lessig came to the MIT Media Lab to address what he believes is the most important issue to address in America:  political corruption, and at its root, that of how political campaigns are funded.</p>
<p>Citing a Rasmussen study, Lessig argues that although 46% of the American public believes that most of Congress is corrupt, the problem is not actually that individual members of Congress are corrupt people who taking corrupt actions, but that the institution as a whole has deteriorated because of the way campaigns are financed &#8212; politicians spend between 30% and 70% of their time raising money for their campaigns.</p>
<p>In the age of the super PAC, Lessig points out that less than 200 individual Americans have given 80% of the money donated in an election cycle.  Forget the idea of the 1% &#8212; Lessig points out that our campaigns are financed by the .0000063%.</p>
<p>Lessig outlines a two part solution to campaign financing.  The first involves publicly financing elections, by taking a tax per citizen and giving it back in the form of democracy vouchers that can be used to support a choice of candidates.  These candidates must agree to take public financing and only accept donations of up to $100 per person.  Such a system would ultimately enable broad participation and also limit the amount any individual can contribute.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Lessig claims, this would not be enough.  Politicians are motivated to use the super PAC model because of the fear that a rival using a super PAC will drop millions of dollars into negative ad campaigns very close to an election.  As such, politicians need to obtain what Lessig calls “super PAC insurance.”  Politicians try to obtain the favor of potential rich donors even before they might ever need to use their money, allowing the donors to obtain influence with actually giving away any money.  Eliminating this arms race would require a constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>So how can this come about?  Lessig’s solution comes down to uniting several effective, yet disparate movements such as the Tea Party and Occupy crowds to get such a constitutional amendment passed.  Ultimately he wants to unite the leaders of these movements behind a common cause &#8212; campaign finance reform.</p>
<p>Is it possible to unite movements of essentially mortal enemies to enact a constitutional amendment?  Lessig points out that even if the situation is hopeless, we need to appeal to patriotism and try.  He recognizes the use of big data as a tool, and urges the community of hackers and programmers to create an infrastructure that will enable more Americans to participate in democracy.  It remains to be seen if enough Americans are motivated to cause the ruckus required to change the constitution.  Even though <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/141512/congress-ranks-last-confidence-institutions.aspx">only 11% of Americans have confidence in Congress</a>, too many are used to sitting on the sidelines feeling powerless.</p>
<p>In today’s world, clicks and pageviews are hard currency.  In order to amass a movement, Lessig should appeal to those who are well-versed in writing headlines and stirring up sensation.  He realizes there is a balance between authenticity and sophistication, but it is unclear if his ideas will travel and have an effect beyond academic circles.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><strong><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2012/02/21/in-animals-presidential-election-lion-takes-on-a-gorilla/img_0096/" rel="attachment wp-att-348"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-348" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_0096-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="342" /></a>BOSTON</strong> &#8211; After a campaign with no debates, tweets, or televised attack ads, Americans voted this week in a presidential election with candidates including a condor, a gorilla and a panda.</p>
<p>Christopher the Lion had an early lead over Gigi the gorilla in the poll of visitors to the Franklin Park Zoo in south Boston, known as a <a href="http://www.zoonewengland.org">PreZOOdential election,</a> a zoo official said, leaking preliminary standings on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“I voted for Christopher, the lion” said Cookie, 9. She said that the lion impressed her and her friend. When they came up to the lion’s enclosure: “He roared. It was really exiting,” she said.</p>
<p>Some of the other animals in the six-animal poll – comprising a gorilla, a red panda, an ocelot, an anteater, an Andean condor as well as Christopher the lion &#8212; were doing less to get attention on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I can’t see him,” one child said of Isidoro the ocelot – the cat was apparently asleep at the back of his cage. His campaign slogan, apparently anticipating his habit of sleeping during the day, says: “see if you can spot a winner.”</p>
<p>The voting began on President’s Day on Monday and runs until Saturday.</p>
<p>Maddie, aged 4, voted for Gigi, the western lowland gorilla, but she and her sister Lily were more impressed by animals not on the ballot.</p>
<p>“I liked the zebra,”she said. “I like black and white.” Lily smiled and said “crocodile” when asked which animal she favoured.</p>
<p>The incumbent president, Kiki, a female western lowland gorilla, has served two consecutive terms since 2006 and so is ineligible to run again and also has a baby to look after. Kiki sat by the glass wall of her enclosure, allowing children to come close to her baby.</p>
<p>“Of course they don’t know about the election,” said Gail O’Malley, overseeing the gorilla’s enclosure where this year’s candidate, Gigi, was sitting behind a tree trunk.<br />
But she said that the election and posters help enliven the enclosures and made people go and learn more about animals they would not normally see, like condors or anteaters.</p>
<p>The solitary Andean condor, Tito, sat hunched on a branch on a tree in his outdoor enclosure, Jockamo the giant anteater, paced up and down his cage.<br />
O’Malley also said that the election also drew more visitors to the zoo by adding an offbeat activity.</p>
<p>Several of the animals have been assigned campaign themes – Gigi the gorilla wants more “enrichment”, a term used for more objects to keep the animals from boredom. In the gorilla’s enclosure that means things such as balls, a puzzle for getting peanuts out of a plastic container with only small holes, new sounds and smells.</p>
<p>The red panda, called Stella Luna, is campaigning for early childhood education – she has two young. And the ocelot, whose natural habitat is a south American jungle but cage has just a couple of green plants, wants more conservation.</p>
<p>The winner, after votes are counted on Saturday, will get the honorary title of “president” and an inauguration party. That means perhaps a favourite treat will be handed over – lions like a chunk of meat, gorillas popcorn and peanuts, and anteaters a special insect dish.</p>
<p>O’Malley said that many children took the voting more seriously than adults did a real election. Young visitors often insisted, for instance, that they could not cast their vote until they’d been round to see all the candidates.</p>
<p>“In my family people simply go and vote for the guy with the Irish name,” she said.</p>

			<p>I view myself as somewhat of an information glutton.</p>
<p>There is a constant explosion of information from various avenues (Social Media, Listservs, Emails, and Meetings etc.) on any given day. I have been mindful of the some of the associated consequences of our current way of life &#8211; from being unproductive to not being completely “present” at our real-world interactions.</p>
<p>So tracking my information consumption was a way to comprehend some of my interactions with information.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this week -long study; I have only included information that I really read or watched. I did not include the Bollywood movie that I watched over the weekend.</p>
<p>The four main categories that I tracked my “information Diet” under included news themes, type of media, sources and origins of information</p>
<div style="width: 595px"><strong><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2012/02/21/information-diet/my-information-diet/" rel="attachment wp-att-245">My Information Diet</a></strong></p>
<div style="padding: 5px 0 12px">
<p><em>As you can see, there are a lot of things going on here; but below are some insights on my information consumption habits and engineering solutions to potentially address some of my particularly knotty habits / practices:<br />
</em><br />
<strong>Filter Bubbles</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html" target="_blank">This Ted talk on &#8220;filter bubbles&#8221; </a> by online organizer Eli Pariser explains how algorithm driven personalized curation of online data can lead to an information junk diet. This pattern of information consumption only reinforces our narrow view of the world which can be harmful to the society at large. He argues that we need to encounter opinions that could challenge and expand our worldview.</p>
<p>A large part of my news consumption seems to revolve around my work projects and other interests. It would be interesting to have a plugin or app on my computer that can create some random variety in my information diet.</p>
<p><strong>Media Bias Review Tool</strong></p>
<p>Having worked in Media over the last few years , I think I have become innately suspicious about every piece of news and the inherent biases within it. If I really care about a particular piece of news, I will view it from various sources. I would love to have a browser plugin that can automatically bring up the same story from various sources along with a social / collaborative notepad to discuss subtle differences in coverage of the news and representation of facts across different news agencies.</p>
<p>ps: I am unable to upload media.So I have a link to Slide Share for my Information Diet presentation . I am getting the following error- &#8221; Unable to create directory /var/www/partnews/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02. Is its parent directory writable by the server?&#8221;</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last Wednesday, immediately prior to attending <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/is-celebrity-news-like-pizza-dipped-in-honey-media-health-and-information-diets">an event on media diets</a>, we presented a week&#8217;s compilation of our own media diets. The day&#8217;s scheduled events were rather meta with regards to conscious information consumption, and this turned out to be, in many ways, a theme of my diet.</p>
<p>Not counting this assignment, other meta media experiences included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching The Matrix with a <a href="http://www.rifftrax.com/">comedic audio track</a> overlay</li>
<li>A <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/mstem/following">Twitter feed</a> following over 1,600 people and organizations, many of them political operatives operating in and around the day&#8217;s headlines</li>
<li>Watching Saturday Night Live lampoon the week&#8217;s news</li>
<li>A substantial period of time attending classes on <a href="../../../../index.html">particpatory news</a> and <a href="http://socialtv.media.mit.edu/mas571/">social television</a> habits</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="width: 650px;height: 1005px;border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;margin: 5px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/media-diet-1-copy.png" alt="My Media Diet" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the chart above, I aggregated the elements of my media diet into five categories (left to right):</p>
<p><strong>Traditional news</strong> consisted of news websites and print magazine subscriptions:<img style="width: 600px;height: 371px;border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;margin: 3px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/chart_5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Relaxation and entertainment</strong> included reading blogs, listening to music during workouts, and watching streaming TV shows on Hulu:</p>
<p><img style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;margin: 3px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/chart_4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Creative production</strong> included writing, notetaking, creating graphics, and giving a presentation:<img style="width: 600px;height: 371px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/chart_6.png" alt="creative production diet" /></p>
<p><strong>Focused learning</strong> included conducting research, learning to code, watching tutorials, and listening to lectures:<img style="width: 600px;height: 371px" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/chart_3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Social intelligence</strong> included Twitter, Gmail, Facebook, instant messaging, and extended face-to-face conversations:</p>
<p><img src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/chart_2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Lean-Forward Information Consumer</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve long been an early adopter and devoted <a href="http://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a> reader. I install and try out most of the programs, plugins, apps, and web services that cross my path. I&#8217;ve chosen lean-forward interaction over lean-back entertainment since I&#8217;ve had access to a modem. As a result, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79ihC5y6Zuo&amp;noredirect=1">how to strike a balance</a> between the potential of digital media and the warmth and history of analog media. And yet there were still a number of surprises gained from obsessively tracking my habits for a week.</p>
<p><strong>Protect Time to Create</strong><br />
Arguably the most disruptive feature of participatory media is that it asks us to write information as well as read it. If consuming media is like consuming food, the metaphor extends to suggest that we consider the creation of media to be a form of exercise. Writing, coding, filming, and otherwise producing original content requires us to flex our creative muscles in a different way, similar to the shift between passively learning a field and actively teaching it to another person.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see how much time I spent actively creating content over the course of the week. My first semester at the Media Lab made it quite clear that it was possible to spend most of one&#8217;s time attending really interesting panels and classes, and reading an endless supply of academic literature, organizational reports, and course readings, all at the expense of producing any original work oneself. The limits imposed by time regularly force a decision between the immediate benefits of listening to someone much smarter than myself, and the longer-term journey to build my own skills and enunciate my own thoughts. I credit my group&#8217;s encouragement (and occasional mandate) to blog frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Status Update as Atomic Unit of News?</strong><br />
Melissa Mayer of Google defended Google News&#8217;s aggregation of content by pointing out that the article has become the atomic unit of the news. Looking over my RescueTime reports, it became clear that sitting down with even an article or full blog post has become a somewhat rare experience during the week. Most of my dedicated news-reading time came during the weekend, like other leisure activities. The many interesting links Twitter tempts me with throughout my work day are bookmarked with a <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/">ReadItLater</a> extension, and then automagically whisked away to wait for me on my Kindle, thanks to a recipe over at <a href="http://ifttt.com/recipes/search?q=kindle">ifttt</a>.</p>
<p>This is not to say that I am not aware of the news during the week. I spend most of my days actively plugged into what&#8217;s happening, but this information comes to me via Twitter, Facebook, and status messages on Gchat. It&#8217;s been written elsewhere, but the combination of real news and social intelligence is a killer combination, one that routinely crowns Twitter my most-consulted news medium. And, if awareness of the top <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> is an indication, these sources effectively keep me informed.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Time vs. Interrupted Time</strong><br />
For the value it provides as a social utility, Facebook really doesn&#8217;t take up much of my time each day (only <img style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;margin: 3px;float: left" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/email.jpg" alt="Pages viewed" />8-10 minutes a day, spread out over more visits than I&#8217;d like to admit). That said, it was clear in my diary that tracking with tools like RescueTime won&#8217;t measure the true distraction of applications like Twitter and Facebook, or the time spent on my phone. The total amount of time spent on these social networks is relatively low, but quick consultations ensure they influence large blocks of time throughout the day.</p>
<p>One way Twitter influences my day more than the accumulated minutes suggest is in its role as provider of clickworthy links. Both RescueTime and my browser history show a large sample of quick hit webpages where I spend under a minute. This is common behavior for users across the web, but I was a bit surprised at just how many pages (over 2,400) I navigated through in a week.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation as Information Medium</strong><br />
<img style="width: 208px;height: 211px;border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;margin: 3px;float: right" src="http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/email2.jpg" alt="email diet" />Ethan hinted that, if we took our media diet tracking far enough, we might begin to consider conversations as a form of media. I decided to go with it, because despite the success of social media platforms, we still receive much of our intelligence in regular conversations with other human beings. I already knew, thanks to <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a>, that weekends are much healthier for me, as I walk and sleep more. Tracking my media diet showed me that weekends are also healthier for my social soul, as I spent much more time in face-to-face conversations.</p>
<p>Lastly, my email inbox was an interesting source of information. A small army of Gmail filters protects my actual inbox, but I still pick up a fair amount of news about political and social campaigns from a wide range of newsletters and listservs. As a result, I currently receive over 14 times more email than I send.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight at the Emerson Arts Theater in Boston, legendary documentary maker Robert Drew spoke to a crowded room about how he changed the documentary world forever.</p>
<p>He was speaking after a double-bill of two of the films he made about John F Kennedy, <em>Primary</em> and <em>Crisis: A Presidential Commitment.</em> The first follows Hubert Humphrey and John F Kennedy as they face off for the Presidency in the 1960 Wisconsin Primary and the second follows the decision-making process inside the White House in 1963 as Jack and Bobby, his Attourney General, move to make desegregation of Schools a reality in the face of opposition in the South.</p>
<p>What makes these films special is not just the fascinating backstage access to one of the world’s best loved politicans, but the introduction of a style of film making that had never been seen before. A handheld camera follows Kennedy and Humphrey as they move through crowds, make phone calls, ride in cars and smile on stages. The voices of the crowd play under shots of the candidates shaking hands, having their photographs taken, the focus blurs as the camera swings to follow action, nervous hands fiddle behind backs, the future President waits in dim light for the votes to be counted. Intimacy and action combine in a new form that became known as cinema verite.</p>
<p>Drew was keen to point out that its not as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>‘Its very hard to get good results in cinema verite style. People think you just follow somebody’. He described how it took 5 years for them to get camera and sound small enough to handhold in the way they did and everything that could go wrong, went wrong every day. ‘I can’t tell you how many times we had flash frames, bad sound or had to lose shots because the camera was too shaky’.</p>
<p>Drew’s crew on these films went on to become the stars of American documentary film making – Albert Maysles, DA Pennebaker and Richard Leacock. Together they evolved a style that would be copied all over the world.</p>
<p>‘Godard shook his camera to look like us and feature films began shaking their camera to look like Godard.’ But Drew insists he would rather not have camera shake. What’s important to him is getting to see &#8216;into other people’s lives&#8217;. ‘It’s a good idea, a powerful idea and I can’t see it going away.’</p>
<p>When asked what he thought of the future of documentaries he had this to say,</p>
<p>‘I predicted that someday you’d be able to walk into a drugstore and buy a camera the size of your fist and shoot better footage than we could with a 16mm camera and it happened. And now I’m making a prediction that talent will rise up. We don’t know where they’ll come from, they might come from business, grade school, the military. We’re seeing it in the footage coming in now from the middle east. Talent will rise up.’</p>
<p>Speaking three days after his 88<sup>th</sup> birthday, Drew left the audience with a sense of optimism for the future of documentary, and at the same time, immediate and intimate images of a remarkable history.</p>

<p><strong>Four-hour challenge:</strong><br />
Start: 19:05 2/18/2012<br />
Finish: 22:26 2/18/2012</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, MA &#8212; Harvard (23-3, 9-1 Ivy) beat Yale again 66-51 to tie the school’s record for victories. Harvard set the program’s record with 23 wins last season, when it tied for first place in the Ivy League.</p>
<p>With four games left in the season, Harvard is on track to claim sole ownership of the Ivy League title this season and make it into the NCAA tournament for the first time since its sole appearance in 1946. The Ivy League does not have a conference tournament so the top team in the league receives an automatic bid for the NCAA tournament next month.</p>
<p>Harvard also extended its home win streak to 27 games, the second longest home court winning streak after Kentucky, which also extended its home winning streak to 50-0. Harvard is 10-0 at home and has yet to lose at Lavietes Pavilion this season.</p>
<p>Led by the inside-outside duo of guard Brandyn Curry and forward Keith Wright, Harvard dominated Yale in virtually every category: field goal percentage, 3-point field goal percentage, rebounds, assists, as well as points in the paint. The Crimson made 54.3% (25-46) of its shots and outrebounded Yale 33-22.</p>
<p>Keith Wright scored 10 points and hauled in 8 rebounds, tying Brian Cusworth’s school career block record with 147. Brandyn Curry led Harvard with 18 points and 5 assists. Guard Oliver McNally added 9 points and 2 assists while forward Kyle Casey chipped in 8 points.</p>
<p>Saturday evening’s loss to Harvard drops Yale’s Ivy League record to 17-7 and 7-3 in the Ivy League. Yale was led by center Greg Mangano, who had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 5 block shots. Unfortunately, Mangano received little support from his teammates, none of whom scored more than 8 points.</p>
<p>Harvard climbed into the Top 25 men’s basketball teams for the first time this season. However, the Crimson fell out of the Top 25 after each loss. Harvard has lost three times this season: to University of Connecticut December 8, Fordham January 3 and Princeton February 11.</p>
<p>Next weekend, Harvard will play Princeton (15-10, 6-3 Ivy) and Penn (15-11, 7-2 Ivy) at home. After that, Harvard will have two more league games against Columbia (14-12, 3-7 Ivy) and Cornell (10-14, 5-5 Ivy).</p>

			<p>I kept track of what news and blogs I was reading over the course of a week. Some interesting takeaways from the data:</p>
<p>I consumed 73% of this media on an iPad, and 88% digitally overall. The remaining 12% is all radio, specifically WBUR. What&#8217;s interesting is that the BBC on WBUR was basically my only source of international news, and international news only comprised 6% of my total media consumption. Half my consumption was about technology or the tech industry, and 12% was national news. The remaining 30% consisted of softer stories about culture.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/zite-personalized-magazine.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="190" align="center" /></p>
<p>One worrisome thing I noticed is that over half my news comes from tailored sources which aren&#8217;t very diverse &#8212; 57% of my news comes from aggregators that filter news, namely Zite and Twitter. Zite learns what I like to give me news stories it thinks I&#8217;ll find relevant, and I choose who to follow on Twitter.</p>
<p>This means that I&#8217;m reading a subset of news, blogs, and tweets which tend to support similar viewpoints, and I&#8217;m missing out on interesting content I don&#8217;t know I even might want to read. I&#8217;m my own news editor, and the more my tastes differ from someone else&#8217;s, the more likely it is that we are reading totally different sets of news. As local newspapers close, personalized news becomes more prevalent, and algorithms better learn what we like, this issue will only get worse. It is less likely that people will get a diverse set of opinions in their news, and it&#8217;s less often that we&#8217;ll have strong national stories which bring us all together as citizens.</p>
