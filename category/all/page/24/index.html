				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>For this assignment, I chose to focus on space exploration and the U.S.&#8217;s transition into the private sector for funding and operations.  Originally, I was pro-space exploration, pro-private-sector funding with government support.  However, one has to ask oneself if attributing such funds for space exploration is moral, when we have poverty and natural disasters affecting billions of people on our planet?  The facts I found were astonishing. Despite being &#8220;pro-space exploration&#8221; and having that undoubtedly shape my research, I wasn&#8217;t aware of NASA&#8217;s Spinoff program.  Spinoff bolsters scientific research and innovations (funded by space exploration money) generated by space exploration research, to help improve living conditions in societies around the world.  To see a more in-depth look into the research coming out of space exploration, visit: <a title="NASA's Spinoff Program" href="http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf">http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf</a></p>
<p>Its important to note that &#8220;people grossly overestimate the budget that NASA gets,&#8221; said Niebur. Obama&#8217;s fiscal year 2016 budget calls for <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/NASA_FY_2016_Budget_Estimates.pdf" target="_blank">$18.5 billion</a> overall for NASA — 0.46 percent of the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7962585/fiscal-year-2016-budget-usa" target="_blank">federal budget</a>. &#8220;Most people think it&#8217;s 10 times that much.&#8221;  Furthermore, according to the <a href="http://planetary.org/" target="_blank">Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit space research and advocacy organization, for the planetary science division to run well, the United States should spend at least $1.5 billion every year to explore other worlds which is less than what &#8220;Americans spent on dog toys in 2012.&#8221; (<em>Vox.com</em>, 2/23/15)</p>
<p>Congress is also set to review NASA&#8217;s 2016 budget request, which is set at $1.2 billion (<em>USA Today</em>, 03/10/15)</p>
<p>To convey my point, and the various facts I collected, I implemented Sketch 3 (<a title="Sketch 3" href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/</a>).  In hopes that this visual representation would have a more compelling and less aggressive impact on my viewers.  I hoped this layout, combined with these images, would provide more compelling evidence for those opposed to any funds being attributed to space exploration (from private of public sources).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve determined that despite the gross amount of funding that is required for space exploration, (especially when that money could be used directly to aid in developing nations and to end poverty and starvation) private sector funding of space exploration not only allows people to continue their grandiose dreams of space exploration, but it&#8217;s also responsible for scientific achievements and improvements that are implemented on a global scale (to improve the lives of billions). <i>Despite global poverty and natural disasters, space exploration funding and action have helped save lives here on Earth.  Continuous private sector funding will expand our presence in space while contributing positive scientific advances in other sectors of society… </i></p>
<p>Please see my composition below, rendered by Sketch 3</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meet Knight Science and Journalism Fellow <a href="https://ksj.mit.edu/fellows/2015/gil-gideon/">Gideon Gil</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2195aa1e822e5f03bea427d900e62fd7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6270" alt="2195aa1e822e5f03bea427d900e62fd7" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2195aa1e822e5f03bea427d900e62fd7-240x300.jpg" width="240" height="300" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2195aa1e822e5f03bea427d900e62fd7-240x300.jpg 240w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2195aa1e822e5f03bea427d900e62fd7.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com">Boston Globe</a> is his professional home, where he’s been <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/staff/gil">Health and Science Editor</a> since 2003.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Boston, where the health, science and tech industries have enormous footprints, that’s no small task.  He has a lot to tell us about, among other things, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6898">whether Harvard can clone humans</a> or <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6894">what happens to unused embryos</a>, stories about which helped his editorial team win the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2005-Explanatory-Reporting">2005 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you remember the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/specials/boston_marathon_bombing/">many medical stories</a> that came out of the Boston Marathon bombings?  Those were was under his watch, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As at many news organizations, the Globe has contended with cutbacks &#8212; its <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/globe_kills_healthscience_sect.php?page=all">dedicated science section was eliminated</a> in 2009, and Gideon’s reporters’ stories now appear throughout the paper and online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He points out that you can always argue for strong science stories &#8211; but concedes the paper may not be doing as much to cover the non-life, and more basic, sciences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://shass.mit.edu/news/news-gideon-gil-knight-science-journalism-fellow-14-15">This year at MIT</a> Gideon is looking at how Big Data from health care can inform the stories his journalists tell.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He’s also <a href="http://shass.mit.edu/news/news-gideon-gil-knight-science-journalism-fellow-14-15">challenging himself in the classroom</a>:  he teamed with some bio-engineering and MBA students to build a version of the <a href="http://blog.eyewire.org/about/">Eye-Wire project</a> that works with Minecraft.</p>
<p>You can see some of that fusion of science and art as far back as the mid-1970s, when he <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/2605/Gideon__Gil/">wrote lively columns about on-campus speakers </a>for the Harvard <em>Crimson</em> (“I’m afraid to go back and look”) as an undergraduate bio-chem major.</p>
<p>(That’s an undergraduate Gideon, below, doing something important with pipettes for a professor at Harvard Med).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-03 at 9.46.49 PM.png" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4YsQtBL432ibDwIC96AKFpH46YTthqB5w8one3e5xpVGyiSMT4tKuGUeMQkEsy7coL_XN678rI6ruqsW2MP8JJISsp5krrg-PI7yBLUyzjV-hnqlt5vI0hV1NXP0kVlcbjmjTkw" width="447px;" height="278px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact Gil thought he’d become a scientist.  But he spent the summer before his senior year at the Quincy <em>Patriot Ledger</em>, and discovered it was “a blast.”  And journalism had one other big benefit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Myself and another (Crimson) columnist had a following of groupies.  Some Wellesley women tracked us down &#8211; and that was tough to do in those pre-Internet days.  So the dating potential of these columns was my first recognition of the non-journalistic purpose of newspapers,” he said in a recent interview.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gil went on to study for a master&#8217;s in journalism at Columbia before giving up the side benefits of the profession to<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/04/style/lisa-a-huber-marries-gideon-gil-a-reporter.html"> marry Lisa Huber in 1985.</a>  The family lives in Wellesley with this guy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">while their 21 year-old daughter Liana is off at Syracuse, getting a degree in television, radio and film and doing <a href="http://dailyorange.com/2014/02/teachable-moments-after-school-program-assists-refugee-students-with-homework/">some other neat things</a>.</p>
<p>Want to know Gideon better?  If you want to fish out the microfilm, you can read through two decades of his stories for the Louisville <em>Courier Journal</em>, where <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3563136?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">he covered the development and use of the artificial heart</a>.  Online or in print you can check out <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/staff/gil">some of his own Globe reporting</a> from here in Boston; or from this class, enjoy his compelling portrait of a <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2015/02/23/an-evening-in-the-er/">Massachusetts ER at night</a>.</p>
<p>Or you could just scan his Twitter feed<a href="https://twitter.com/globegideon"> @GlobeGideon</a> to see the range of his interests and the many science topics he follows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What I try to do,” he explains, “is to help staff do deep narrative and explanatory pieces about what’s happening in the world of medicine and science.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Does he succeed?  Let’s hear from Beth Daley, a former <em>Globe</em> science and environment writer, who calls herself one of his biggest fans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">The best anecdote about Gideon is being edited on <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/specials/lyme-disease?p1=Article_Related_Box_Article_More">a series many initially pooh-poohed at the Globe: Lyme disease</a>.  Gideon, in his calm, thorough and mellow way went to bat for me, doing his own research to convince the higher-ups this seemingly odd story to focus a year on was one of the most important of our time. Not because we were writing about a disease, but because Lyme Disease represented a far more important point: A reluctance by the medical establishment to try and deal with uncertainty. It was classic Gideon &#8211; taking a small point to illustrate something even bigger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He is also incredibly thorough &#8211; maddeningly so, virtually every reporter who works for him will tell you. For years, I would be tapping my foot at 9:30 p.m., front page editor yelling for copy before the presses ran, and Gideon would, ever calm, be going through a story line by line. He invariably would catch major errors, and add in context from some recess of his brain.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s very gentle, incredibly loyal.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s high praise from a reporter for an editor.   If you’re interested in good science writing, you should probably try to get to know him too.</p>

			<p>Two hundred people died in an avalanche &#8211; not in the French alps, but in the Philippine capital of Manilla.  It was an avalanche of garbage that the city had thrown away. Hours later, David Jiménez Garcia stood at the bottom of the carnage of a monsoon-induced landslide that had weakened the base of a municipal waste dump and had ultimately caused it to collapse upon the homes of 800 families. “I couldn&#8217;t believe that there weren’t more journalists who cared,” Jiménez remembers today, speaking with a sonorous, soothing voice, as his hands rose up and crashed down to give life to the garbage avalanche.</p>
<p>While the government of the Philippines blamed the prowess of mother nature in 2000, Jiménez covered the stories of those who fell victim to it. Particularly those who had been stripped of alternatives by the government: The disenfranchised, the impoverished, the abandoned. Children are often the center of Jiménez’ stories, which are full of intimate observations, piercing detail, and illustrative context. The empathy and precision in his reporting are testimony to his long-standing experience in the region: David Jiménez Garcia was the first-ever Asia correspondent of a major Spanish newspaper.</p>
<p>His life began in Barcelona in 1971, when his native Spain was still under Franco’s rule. Born into a dictatorship, Jiménez grew up as his country grew into a new democracy. With the progressives rebuilding the government, his childhood coincided with the introduction of freedom of the press for Spaniards for the very first time. At 12, his family, including three siblings, moved to Madrid. After a high school exchange year in rural Texas, Jiménez enrolled at the local journalism school. Freelancing with Spain’s leading newspaper El Mundo during his last year in college turned into his first job.</p>
<p>At El Mundo, Jiménez covered whatever topic he could get his hands on. “Anything you can do in a newsroom, I did,” he remembers, before recounting how he walked into his editor-in-chief’s office one day with an idea: Latin America, Africa, and Europe were sought-after locations, while no Spanish newspaper had an Asia bureau or correspondent on the continent at the time. Jiménez wanted to go. His boss agreed and in 1998, David Jiménez Garcia became El Mundo’s first Asia correspondent. He stayed for 15 years.</p>
<p>Based first in Hong Kong and then in Bangkok, Jiménez covered wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, East Timor, Kashmir, and Sri Lanka; he reported on the two big tsunamis and five earthquakes, on revolutions in Burma and uprisings in the Philippines. He contributed to CNN, the BBC, The Guardian, and Esquire magazine. He wrote three books. He won awards.</p>
<p>Most reports penned by Jiménez are heavy human interest stories, playing out in the darkest corners of the world. But many turned into lighter endings. Jiménez chases these endings, following up on his stories and seeking out his former interviewees. “You owe something to the people you wrote about,” he says, “if you care about them, you go back and try to tell the end of the story.” He compiled a selection of juxtapositions, between the tragedy he witnessed during chaos and the uplifting denouement he often found upon returning years later, in his award-winning first book, <i>Children of the Monsoon</i>. Within a few years, <i>Buttons of Kabul</i> and <i>The Happiest Place on Earth</i> followed, equally filled by accounts of resilience, loyalty, and dedication in the face of poverty and violence. Always, Jiménez’ “prose is sharp as a machete” as Brook Larmer lauds, while La Republica calls his work “a journalistic battle against the demons of cynicism.”</p>
<p>Despite the adventurous, nomadic lifestyle of a war correspondent with endless travel and without set hours confined to an office, Jiménez seems to be battling these exact demons. Writing, for him, is a “a chance to fight against the indifference of the people who don’t have the chance to see what you see,” in the hope that his reporting would eventually impact people, move institutions to action, and affect small change.</p>
<p>An aficionado of in-depth investigation on the ground, Jiménez says some parts of the internet accrue to a “Weapon of Mass Disinformation”: Given the new wealth of facts and knowledge on the web, the average reader, viewer, and listener is so bombarded by digital artifacts that sifting through for quality, accuracy and genuine intellectual engagement has become a gargantuan task. And we have become lazy. Nonetheless, Jiménez muses that the visual avenues of the web are promising. Because the more ways to illustrate and distribute high quality stories, the better. Jiménez remains a journalistic zealot at heart.</p>
<p>Yet after 15 years of covering upheaval, hardship, and perseverance of the human spirit, Jiménez stopped. Now, reflecting on the luxury that the Nieman Fellowship at Harvard affords him, he has realized the toll that immersion into the extremes of the human condition has taken on him. “As a journalist you have a bag that you carry on your trips,” Jiménez says, shouldering an imaginary backpack as he talks, “and every time you see something bad and report on the darkest side of humanity one stone goes in the bag.” His fictitious rucksack is getting heavier. “At some point you can’t carry the bag anymore.” Support in such heavy moments comes from his family: After particularly gruesome trips, Jiménez’ wife and three kids pull him back to normality. This contrast is important, he says, to ground him in reality.</p>
<p>Three years ago, after Jiménez reported a story about self-immolating monks on an illegal trip to Tibet, the Chinese government banned him from re-entering the country. Jiménez smiles proudly when he tells this story, adding “it means I did my job well.”</p>

			<p>As I was doing background research for my conversation with Léa, I learned that our digital social circles overlap. My discovery that we share a mutual friend&#8211;thanks, Facebook and LinkedIn&#8211;opened up a wide-ranging conversation into our shared interests, as revealed bit by bit by Léa&#8217;s digital footprint. Here&#8217;s a podcast-style summary of our conversation along those lines.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/michael-greshko/lea-steinacker-1">CLICK HERE FOR PART 1 (SOUNDCLOUD)</a></p>
<p>Our conversation, though, ventured beyond our shared hobbies. We talked at length about her longtime work on issues related to gender-based violence and her transition into tackling a similarly vexing challenge: that of radicalization of Islamists in Germany. Her studies have taken her around the world and back again: With NGO positions in countries including Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Rwanda, and Australia&#8211;not to mention study-abroad stints in the US, UK, Australia, Tanzania, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pphr/lea_steinacker_11.pdf">Kenya</a>, and Egypt&#8211;she has seen and done a great deal, all fastidiously tracked on her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/l%C3%A9a-steinacker/27/488/779">LinkedIn page</a>. But I noticed that one little part seemed at first glance to be slightly inaccurate. Her work experience says that she worked with the NGO Search for Common Ground in the Democratic Republic of the Congo through March 2013. However, I dug up a November 2012 article from <em><a href="http://www.wz-net.de/wz_10_110184087-21-_La-Steinacker-wird-evakuiert.html">Walsroder Zeitung</a></em>, her hometown German newspaper, saying that she&#8217;d been evacuated from the country. Why was there this discrepancy? Was it a discrepancy at all? Had she been evacuated, only to return to finish up in March 2013? Surely LinkedIn was hiding some fascinating details&#8211;and it was. Listen below for more:</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/michael-greshko/linkedin-malaria-and-a-line-of-jeeps">CLICK HERE FOR PART 2 (SOUNDCLOUD)</a></p>
<p>In all, I&#8217;m struck by how examining a conversation partner&#8217;s digital footprint beforehand can influence conversation&#8211;for good or for ill. Revealing that we had a mutual friend on Facebook, for instance, was like an invitation from the &#8220;real world&#8221; to talk about that friend, easing us into conversation in a highly effective way. Other revelations, however, were more jarring. Léa was surprised or slightly embarrassed that I&#8217;d found some digital breadcrumbs (e.g. an uncomfortably enthusiastic review of her performance in a play), and in one instance, she&#8217;d forgotten she&#8217;d even created one of the online resources I found. Without warning, I asked her near the end of our conversation if she was a fan of the Trina Paulus book <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_for_the_Flowers">Hope for the Flowers</a>.</em> Shocked, she said yes, utterly confused as to how I knew that. It turns out that her fling with Myspace must have been near-instantaneous. <a href="https://myspace.com/hopefortheflowers/">Her old account</a>, named &#8220;hopefortheflowers,&#8221; is still up and running, but she couldn&#8217;t remember making it&#8211;a digital fossil from an earlier time, I suppose.</p>
<p>It also hits home to me just how pervasive our digital footprints can be.</p>

<p>I knew a tiny bit about Austin Hess beforehand from listening up in class &#8211; mainly that he was editor-in-chief of the MIT Tech, and thus I presumed that he was an MIT senior, probably around 21.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6175" style="color: #333333;font-style: normal" alt="1" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-1024x340.png" width="584" height="193" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-1024x340.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-300x99.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-500x166.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></p>
<p>When I sat down to Internet stalk Austin Hess, I first came across what I thought was his Twitter. The handle was @AustinHess, the photo was of a youngish male, and the location stated Boston, MA. Not bad huh? Everything checked out, so I scrolled down the tweets, excited that I was going to get a glimpse into his inner psyche.</p>
<p>Reading his tweets, this Austin Hess seemed something like a raging Tea Party affiliate with hashtags like #EmperorObama and um, #oldmanass. I began imagining Austin in my head, this 30-year-old, angry, married, but also an MIT student working at the Tech. I was kind of looking forward to interviewing someone who seemed like my direct opposite in every way.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6176" alt="2" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-1024x390.png" width="584" height="222" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-1024x390.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-300x114.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-500x190.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>A few more Google searches and I realized I was totally off base. The MIT Austin was someone else entirely. He unfortunately was not nearly as public with social media as Tea Party Austin but I was able to dredge up some old articles about his high school career. From what I could find of him in high school, he seemed like he was a really bright, accomplished person and really into science, specifically physics and space (the kind of kid that would get into MIT!)</p>
<p>Then in college, I dig some digging and found a short blog he wrote while interning at CERN when the Higgs Boson discovery was announced. I found all his articles that he wrote for the Tech, including some recent ones regarding the Walter Lewin case at MIT. …And that was it!</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6177" alt="3" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3-1024x349.png" width="584" height="199" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3-1024x349.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3-300x102.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3-500x170.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>So it was on to the interview to get to know more about him. I went to the Tech offices on the 4th floor of the MIT student center at around 5PM on a Saturday. While the floor was basically empty, behind the locked doors of the Tech were over 20 people in various rooms talking and working. After finally locating Austin, we found an empty room and began talking.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6178" alt="4" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-1024x357.png" width="584" height="203" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-1024x357.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-300x104.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-500x174.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>Austin talked about being editor-in-chief of the Tech. He enjoyed controversial stories and hearing people&#8217;s back-and-forth on it. One of his bigger, controversial stories was on Walter Lewin, who he even had some back and forth with over email. &#8220;It was a really surreal experience. Some of the email conversations were very strange. And at the end he got very mad that he still wasn&#8217;t portrayed in a positive light.&#8221; Huge swaths of people got really angry at the Tech and wrote comments and emails on a story that he initially thought was quite straightforward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the former editor-in-chiefs told Austin before his tenure, &#8220;This is going to be a crazy time but you&#8217;ll learn more than you will in any MIT class.&#8221; Though Austin doubted him at the time, he in the end found it a learning experience: learning how organizations work but also how complicated issues can get between what&#8217;s in the news and what actually happens. It also made him a little disappointed in the MIT community from time to time, because he was often on the receiving end of what he considered to be extreme voices.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6180" alt="5" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-1024x377.png" width="584" height="215" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-1024x377.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-300x110.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-500x184.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>Austin also talked about his time interning at CERN during the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs Boson, which was a unique and very exciting experience. He remembered all the practice announcements, arguments between scientists, and staying up all night in line waiting for the final big announcement.</p>
<p>While it was a definite high point, possibly one of the greatest high points for physics for many years to come, this also made him realize during this time that he wasn&#8217;t that interested in pursuing physics research further. He saw that many post-docs and graduate students working on the Higgs Boson, a truly tremendous project, were still leaving the field and leaving research altogether just several months later.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6181" alt="6" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6-1024x385.png" width="584" height="219" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6-1024x385.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6-300x112.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6-500x188.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, he told me about his plans for the future, including most likely (*maybe, maybe not) working at the New York Times as a software engineer, a job that would combine his interests in technical subjects and the news in a city where things are happening all the time! Looks like you have a really bright and exciting future ahead, Austin!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Bianca Datta spends a lot of time with objects. We all do, but not like her; she designs them, makes them, thinks about them, and responds to questions from prying interviewers about them.</p>
<p>Bianca is a product designer and first-year graduate student in the MIT Media Lab’s Object-Based Media group. I wanted to learn a bit about her design sense and the ways she relates to objects in particular, so I showed her seven objects that each sparked a conversation about different aspects and stages of her life.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/01-maryland.gif"><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/01-maryland.gif" alt="01-maryland" width="750" height="410" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6130" /></a></p>
<p>I started off easy. Bianca is from Maryland—Montgomery County, not Baltimore, which most people mistakenly assume (or maybe they just don’t know any other cities in Maryland). She explained her home state as a &#8220;microcosm of the US,&#8221; which, looking at the state’s map, she attributed in part to its geography. The peninsula, the panhandle, and the two major metropolitan areas each form their own identity.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/02-penn.jpg"><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/02-penn.jpg" alt="02-penn" width="400" height="373" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6131" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/02-penn.jpg 400w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/02-penn-300x279.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/02-penn-321x300.jpg 321w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Bianca then set off to Philadelphia to study at Penn’s School of Engineering. She knew that she wanted her work to have energy applications, and started off focusing on chemical engineering, but later found a home in Penn’s materials science lab as a Materials Science and Engineering major. She claims that chemical engineering didn’t work out because she is &#8220;not into math or physics,&#8221; which befuddled me. It’s all relative.</p>
<p>Bianca has many Penn mugs (all gifts) and paraphernalia, and when I ask which is her favorite, she ponders for a while: &#8220;that’s really tough. I have so many.&#8221; She settles on a hoodie that she got for being a residential advisor, which she likes not only for the color and comfort, but its associations; it reminds her of home, as well as camaraderie with her fellow RAs.</p>
<p>The mug itself also had significance: &#8220;I am really big on tea,&#8221; she says (she was late to our meeting because she was getting coffee). She associates tea with her family, and uses it as a way to connect with people; as an RA, she would offer tea to students to encourage them to stay and talk. Nowadays she organizes many of the Media Lab teas.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03-dormitron.jpg"><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03-dormitron-1024x797.jpg" alt="03-dormitron" width="584" height="454" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6132" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03-dormitron-1024x797.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03-dormitron-300x233.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/03-dormitron-385x300.jpg 385w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>At Penn, Bianca took a formative product design class that led her towards her current work. One of the projects in that class was Dormitron, an RFID-operated door, which would replace your dorm’s traditional key with an RFID chip, making your dorm&#8217;s door work like the key card in the campus entrance, or a bit like a hotel room.</p>
<p>Bianca first downplayed the project by saying &#8220;every year somebody does an RFID thing [for the class],&#8221; and mentioned that there are still barriers to wide adoption due to security liabilities. But she also insisted that her team’s product was better designed than others. Although she regrets not being able to participate in the product’s actual fabrication, it was her first opportunity to go from idea to product.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/05-3m.jpg"><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/05-3m.jpg" alt="05-3m" width="300" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6133" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/05-3m.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/05-3m-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Bianca spent one college summer in Minneapolis working for 3M, which introduced her to the corporate working world as a materials engineer. She was simultaneously impressed with the range of 3M and with their level of trust in her expertise and experience.</p>
<p>Her summer at 3M convinced her to go to graduate school, maybe to postpone the red tape (or poster tape?) of major corporations, and because she found that the most interesting work at 3M was being done by people with PhDs. It seemed like a good sign.</p>
<p>Although she was not working on improving 3M’s poster tape, she did have strong opinions: &#8220;I hate command hooks. They’re useless and always fall off the wall.&#8221; She points to 3M as proving that generic products are not all the same; her 3M sticky-notes stayed on longer and left less residue than the non-branded alternatives. Still, she notes, it’s not always worth the added cost.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/06-flip.jpg"><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/06-flip.jpg" alt="06-flip" width="348" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6134" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/06-flip.jpg 348w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/06-flip-150x150.jpg 150w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/06-flip-298x300.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></a></p>
<p>Along with Partnews RA Alexis Hope, Bianca designed a digital input/output device during the famed Media Lab class &#8220;How to Make Almost Anything.&#8221; The project was initially an excuse to try out the Processing programming environment, which allows for interesting visual effects. If you press a button, the background changes; this allowed them to switch between a &#8220;moon&#8221; view and a &#8220;sunrise&#8221; view for the object.</p>
<p>Bianca&#8217;s final and favorite How to Make project was a nap pod called DUSK, which she tells me currently exists and lives in the Media Lab, so I plan to find it and sleep in it tomorrow. For her the project was exciting because she made it from scratch; it was &#8220;in my head, and now it’s real, and its big, and I get to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/07-stuffmatters.jpg"><img src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/07-stuffmatters-682x1024.jpg" alt="07-stuffmatters" width="584" height="876" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6135" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/07-stuffmatters-682x1024.jpg 682w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/07-stuffmatters-200x300.jpg 200w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/07-stuffmatters.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>This book was on Bianca&#8217;s otherwise defunct Goodreads page, so she was surprised that I&#8217;d found it. On one hand Goodreads was just a &#8220;one-off thing&#8221; for her, but on the other, &#8220;this book is all about what I do.&#8221; It is a popular-scientific approach to materials and objects, with successive chapters on cement, paper, grass, and so on. Bianca’s current research examines how human beings relate and connect to materials; for instance, why we view some materials as stable, friendly, and durable, while others are considered foreign or cold. So this book is right up her alley.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Bianca prefers paper reading over screen reading, which gives off the illusion of being &#8220;less serious.&#8221;  But like most people, she makes plenty of concessions for the sake of digital convenience.</p>
<p>Bianca read <em>Stuff Matters</em> at Cambridge&#8217;s local <a href="http://www.mos.org/public-events/book-club-for-the-curious">Book Club for the Curious</a>. As a first-year student, she felt like this connected her to the city and community. Whether tea mugs, hoodies, or books, Bianca associates her favorite objects with their social functions and associations. As an expert in things, her favorite things are the ones that connect her to her favorite people.</p>
