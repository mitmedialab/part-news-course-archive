			<p>I started this data visualization set at 4.30 pm today and finish it almost four hours later. This is the first time I try to visualize several data sets using CartoDB, after participating in a workshop on using this tool last January.</p>
<p>The idea is combining three different data sets about natural disasters in Indonesia (floods, landslides and forest fire) to see the places where it happened most of the time in 2014, and then layered it with a map of places where non oil and gas mining operates in the country.</p>
<p>I suspect that most of these disasters happened in places where nature has lost its ability to sustain the balance, due to over exploitation of the resources. Obviously, although the trigger is natural cause, disasters such as flood, landslides and forest fire are basically human made.</p>
<p>All of the data sets used here are taken from government database, available at http://data.go.id.</p>
<p>I try to find other relevant datasets to combine the disasters map, such as: industrial zone maps, deforestation map, oil and gas mining zone, but unfortunately, those map don&#8217;t have similar georeference codes that can be read in CartoDB. So I finally settled with only a distribution map of the non-oil and gas mining industry.</p>
<p>Initially I wasn&#8217;t sure how to make the connection because Indonesia has more that 1.000 mining locations spread all over the archipelago, but then I found the torque heat animation which I think can represent the different concentration level of the mining industry in different places. The heat animation can highlight and contrast the disasters map which are only represented by different colors of simple circles.</p>
<p>From doing this exercise, I realize the complexity of data visualization, the importance of having a clean data set and the powerful image it can give to the audience. I hope when people look at this map, they can really make the connection between these horrible disasters and the mining industry that for years have been operating without a clear environmental regulation and oversights.

<p>This new exhibit at the MIT Museum has the purpose of reminding us of the second part of the definition: places are there for people to use, interact in and transform into incredible and wonderful sights.</p>
<p>Founded in 1983, Places Journal has tried &#8220;to see places in new ways&#8221; as the editors wrote, and this exhibit offers us a glimpse of those new ways of seeing places around the world.</p>
<p>Since the Journal was co-founded by an architecture faculty at MIT and the University of California, Berkeley, it seems only logical that after 32 years, MIT Museum would display some of its more relevant pieces.</p>
<p>21 photographers, from the famous Joel Sternfeld to Maria Cox, give us a new way of apprehending places where people live and feel. A lot of the photographs in the exhibit present New York places but don&#8217;t worry you will also encountered very unknown place such as Kyrgyzstan sights from Margaret Morton for example.</p>
<p>Enjoy a small preview in the exhibit by clicking the link below. New ways of showing the world deserved a new way of displaying quotes and a few pieces present in the exhibit.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I started the story below just over four hours ago with an interview. I suppose I should add a slight reflection/qualification first. We often hear about students having bad experiences with MIT medical leave or readmission after it. It&#8217;s often tough, though, to sort out legitimate complaints that can serve as the basis of a critical story from hearsay or more dubious objections to a process that will likely leave people disappointed even in the best case. But in this case, between the possible legal action (with decent precedent), the crowdfunding campaign, significant attention and support from on-campus email lists, the subject&#8217;s own documentation and willingness to go on-the-record, and the added issue of financial hardship during medical leave, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally explore this issue. I only had time to incorporate one side, but I hope to add in all the nuance later that I think makes this story interesting.</p>
<p>That being said, this story is not ready to go to print. Due to the four hour limit, I have yet to get/seek comment from MIT (though it will likely just be a &#8220;no comment&#8221; for privacy reasons). I also want to incorporate far more documents and direct quotes into a longer, more interesting piece for The Tech. And since colorful writing or its absence so often makes or breaks feature/profile pieces, and this piece feels so dry, I expect a lot of revision will be necessary.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite used to writing stories quickly in news style, but getting even the skeleton of a profile done in 2.5 hours from a 1.5 hour interview is pretty tough. In retrospect, perhaps this wasn&#8217;t the best choice of topic given the time constraint, but it also grew significantly over the course of the interview.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the current version:</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>According to Joshua Hernandez, his story is not uncommon at MIT. Following his February 2013 stay at McLean psychiatric hospital in Belmont due to an “intense depressive episode,” he went on voluntary medical leave from the Institute. Two years and two failed applications for readmission later, his fledgling campaign to raise money to mount a legal challenge to MIT’s latest decision has prompted discussion on campus — and commiseration from those with similar stories they say stem from a flawed approach by MIT administrators.</p>
<p>Hernandez feels the latest denial of his readmission application lacked a solid medical basis and said it runs counter to the recommendations of his therapist — a possible violation of Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. But he also emphasized the struggles embarking on medical leave without stable finances or home life, stresses he described as comparable to those at MIT.</p>
<p>Hernandez knew he had bipolar II disorder before a period of depression and resulting alcohol abuse led to his hospitalization. His assigned therapist summarized his progress during his stay to MIT Mental Health, a division of MIT Medical tasked with handling the clinical side of such cases. A day before his discharge, he learned from MIT Student Support Services (S^3) that he had little choice but to voluntarily go on medical leave. “I was told that it would be extremely difficult for me to return to MIT” if forced onto mandatory leave, he said.</p>
<p>Though Hernandez said he was upset with the decision and felt it was “not handled as well as I think it could be,” he said, “Ultimately I did kind of agree with … the assessment that I could use time away from MIT.”</p>
<p>His next move, though, was less straightforward. Hernandez, whose family lives in Mexico, said his situation at home was unstable, partially due to fraught relationships with his parents. He said MIT pushed for him to move back in with his them, though he deemed it impossible due to complications of moving internationally and the emotional toll of living at home.</p>
<p>He ended up staying with a friend in Cambridge and attending five weeks of daily therapy through the Triangle Program in Boston at the behest of MIT. He said that the daily commitments made it even more difficult to find work, already a difficult prospect for someone seeking temporary positions without an undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>MIT requires students on medical leave to take classes or work full time while away from the Institute, but Hernandez expressed displeasure with the policy, suggesting it was extremely stressful for students with few resources to quickly find employment.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of biased against … people that come from poor families because it assumes you have a stable home environment to return to.” In addition to difficulties finding work and residence, Hernandez said his finances were complicated by the loss of his high degree of financial aid, which, along with an on-campus job, he had counted on to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Hernandez moved to Seattle in May 2013 to live with his stepfather and began to work as an online physics tutor while still meeting with a therapist regularly.</p>
<p>His first proposal for readmission, submitted in November and December of 2013, included letters of recommendation from his employer and therapist, an academic plan, an essay about what he learned from his time away, and a detailed list of his activities since his hospitalization.</p>
<p>When he learned from a call with MIT Mental Health that his insomnia had endangered his readmission bid, he went to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed and successfully treated for sleep apnea, and he informed S^3 of the development. He said his therapist was confident that his alcohol abuse was only a symptom of his depressive episodes — one that had not resurfaced since his hospitalization — and told MIT as much. Nevertheless, insomnia and alcohol abuse were listed as the reasons for denial of his readmission proposal in January 2014.</p>
<p>Hernandez was upset that his application was denied due to issues — insomnia and excessive drinking — that he felt had come under control and were unlikely to plague him at MIT. Nevertheless, he continued his leave, still working as a tutor and eventually moving in with grandparents in Mexico. When he applied for readmission in late 2014, he felt confident he had addressed all the issues that had derailed his previous bid.</p>
<p>But in a four-way phone interview with MIT Mental Health and S^3 representatives, he was asked how he planned to control his violent tendencies, which Hernandez said had never been an issue or even concern throughout his illness, treatment, or leave. He said he told the interviewers about his displeasure with MIT’s process and what he considered their far-fetched concerns.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, he said, his application was rejected again, this time with unspecified concerns from an S^3 dean as the critical factor.</p>
<p>Hernandez thinks the vague medical basis of the rejection is a violation of section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires “reasonable accommodations” for illnesses including mental issues, and said he hopes to see broader changes in MIT medical leave policy in addition to the reversal of his readmission denial. He is firm in his judgment that MIT officials are in the wrong, but he still insists that they are well intentioned and that tough decisions on medical leave are still sometimes necessary.</p>
<p>Though he didn’t want to go into detail about his legal options, he said that he is interested in keeping a lawyer who specializes in higher education student mental health cases on retainer with any funds raised by the crowdfunding campaign, which he described as a long-shot idea suggested by his friend. As the fundraising link has circulated on certain campus lists, the vast majority of commenters have expressed support. Hernandez said three quarters of the messages he has received about the issue have described similar experiences with medical leave readmission applications.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Turning the corner onto St. Mary’s Street in Brookline amid the snow and slush, my friend Seth perked up: He could smell the chiles from here, and he already approved. A group of friends and I had walked for half an hour to get here, slopping through the cold for the chance to warm ourselves up—mouths and all—at <a href="http://laosichuan.com/">Sichuan Gourmet</a> in Brookline, the fiery, fantastic Chinese restaurant with four Boston-area locations.</p>
<p>Walking inside—especially in from the cold—brings a sense of efficient comfort, an unpretentious amalgam of tile ceilings, dineresque seating and dashes of Chinese art framed on the walls. There’s no need for fanciness here. This operation is all about the food, a single-minded focus that owner Li Zhong and head chef Liu Lijun brought with them from Chengdu, Sichuan’s capital. The pair are committed to authenticity, serving up delicious dishes and correctives to a notion that “Szechuan” is less a cuisine from China’s misty, mountainous <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/sichuan">southern province</a> and more a code phrase for “chili oil and peppercorns.”</p>
<p>The menu coaxes us away from that Sichuan-as-spice fallacy, offering up a suite of appetizers that give diners a way to dip their toes in the water. (That said, the more adventurous can gun straight for the “Sichuan Delicacies” just below, all of which run spicier.) Perhaps the best are their scallion pancakes, their crispy, still-hot exteriors gently protecting a buttery, flaky interior dotted with herby scallions. It’s almost impossible to think of ways to improve upon them—and then the waitress brings over a small dish of soy sauce for it. The pancakes don’t need it, but I’m a sucker for the added saltiness and flavor—and dabbing some on does nothing to diminish the pancakes’ fantastic crunch.</p>
<div id="attachment_5663" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.09.17.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5663" class="size-medium wp-image-5663" alt="The scallion pancakes." src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.09.17-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.09.17-300x168.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.09.17-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.09.17-500x281.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5663" class="wp-caption-text">The scallion pancakes.</p></div>
<p>The deliciousness—and the spice—only goes up from there. Helpfully, the menu offers up chili peppers next to most menu items. One means that the food is “hot and spicy”; get two chili peppers, and you can bet that the food is “very spicy.” They mean it when they say it—the food will roast and toast you—but it’s not punitive in its heat. Each dash of burn is more than matched with rich flavor. It’s true for the beef with spicy chili sauce (two peppers), each peppercorn-flecked piece of beef and bak choi bathed in broth and chili oil to scrumptious effect. It’s true for the dried chicken with chili sauce (one pepper), each squared-off, orange-brown piece fried to a light crisp. They explode with flavor, each succulent piece like a savory, chili-infused firecracker.</p>
<div id="attachment_5665" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.20.52.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5665" class="size-medium wp-image-5665" alt="Pan fried noodles with vegetables." src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.20.52-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.20.52-300x168.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.20.52-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-21-14.20.52-500x281.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5665" class="wp-caption-text">Pan fried noodles with vegetables.</p></div>
<p>And it’s true for the vegetable pan-fried noodles (no peppers), perhaps the most unwieldy of the dishes we ordered: a bed of water chestnuts, broccoli, bak choi, and baby corn dribbled over a bed of crunchy noodles that, at their center, had soaked up the vegetables’ juices. Dividing up the dish four ways was easily the most uncomfortable part of the meal but well worth it. The crackle of the noodles, in contrast with the tender baby corn, makes for a satisfying vegetarian treat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we finished up our meal—snapping up our final mouthfuls of rice and fully thawed from our walk in the cold—my friends and I exchanged glances, our faces gently reddened by the spice and the joy at finding such delicious food. “Yeah, we’re going to need to make this a thing,” Seth says. I’m happy to say I agree.</p>

			<p><strong>The Lego Movie – review</strong></p>
<p>“A totalitarian-capitalist fantasy,” I said to myself, after watching the “<a href="http://www.thelegomovie.com/">The Lego Movie</a>”, a computer-animated movie that Fox News <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rprB_VNm3L8">slammed </a>as an anti-capitalist propaganda. Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the movie is based on the LEGO line of construction toys and was released on February 7. With a 100-minute run time, “The LEGO Movie” is a roller-coaster <i>commercial</i> that leaves you kicking for more: the LEGO world is impressively well-rendered in the form of a plastic phantasmagoria, the storyline is packed with satirical zingers and the voice cast is exceptional.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Lego_Movie_poster.jpg"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/The_Lego_Movie_poster.jpg" width="300" height="444" /></a></p>
<p>Set in a clockwork world of LEGO elements, “The LEGO Movie” tells the story of Emmet Brickowski (<a title="Chris Pratt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pratt">Chris Pratt</a>), an ordinary LEGO construction worker with no special abilities. His life in his world— where everything is routine, mundane and predictable— feels like a cog in the machine. It is a world where he is happy to pay $37 for a cup of coffee and sing along to upbeat faux pop anthem “Everything Is Awesome.” In short, he is a model citizen of the LEGO world which is controlled by Lord Business (<a title="Will Ferrell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell">Will Ferrell</a>), an evil tyrant who wants everything built in the world according to his vision and instructions. Life for Emmet is hunky-dory until he runs into Wyldstyle (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Banks">Elizabeth Banks</a>), a flamboyant and fearless LEGO female, and falls in with a group of extraordinary LEGO builders, called the Master Builders, who can construct anything without instruction manuals. The Master Builders—led by Vitruvius (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>), a white-haired wizard—mistakenly take Emmet for “The Special”, a Master Builder who is prophesized to save the world from the evil plans of Lord Business, who is conspiring to freeze the entire LEGO world so that people cannot tamper with the idealized vision of his LEGO world. The rest of the plot follows the journey of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces">archetypical </a>hero who reluctantly accepts the call to adventure and, in doing so, realizes his heroic destiny.</p>
<p>Coming back to the capitalist vs. anti-capitalist import of the movie, I found the movie to be a cleverly-executed LEGO corporation commercial, which echoes the radical marketing of Apple’s Super Bowl advertisement in 1984.  While one can see streaks of a proletariat revolutionary in the protagonist of the movie, the ending of the movie suggests that the protagonist has a rather benign agenda— i.e. reconciliation with capitalism in the form of “<a href="http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/25382224-421/the-lego-movie-comedy-and-visuals-connect-in-spectacular-fashion.html">balancing creativity with a follow-the-rules approach to life</a>.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Mark Kermode, a film critic, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/lego-movie-review-mark-kermode">describes </a>“the repositioning of luddite LEGO bricks [in form of this movie] as a saleable staple of the digital gaming revolution” as “one of the greatest marketing coups of the 21st century.”</p>
<p>So in a world of conglomerates and big money, if a global corporation produces a <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1722439/lego-movie-breaks-presidents-day-box-office-records.jhtml">record-breaking</a> commercial film with a commoditized narrative that makes a case for an anodyne individuality in a global business order, what would you call it? A successful product or propaganda marketing or an opiate for the masses, I leave it up to the reader to decide.</p>
<p>With a current IMDB rating of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/">8.5</a>, the movie has grossed nearly <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lego.htm">$200 million</a> worldwide in its first 10 days of release.</p>

			<p>I find myself standing in front of my new enterprise. I’m not sure how I got here, but I’m determined to find out. The sun is shining, and I am clad in a starched khaki ensemble. The sign in front of the entrance says “Alaska Animal Sanctuary.”</p>
<p>My operating budget appears to exceed 30,000 Zollars, and climbing fast. However, I seem to be the only zookeeper. I walk over to the elephants who appear to be under my care, and offer several bananas. They are enthused. Then, I visit the Rhinoceroses and give them a bath.</p>
<p>Why am I here?</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xarTKZWJtpo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>My days become routine. Feed the animals. Clean up the poop. An endless stream of challenges follow me each day, promising increased animal satisfaction, and increased guest happiness.</p>
<p>I sleep fitfully and recall in a rare dream that I used to manage large cities in a past life. I was the mayor of <a href="http://www.simcity.com" target="_blank">Sim City</a>. And now I am a Zookeeper.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I am invited to leave Alaska and join a troubled zoo in the United Kingdom. Anything to break the monotony. I pack my bags, and head to Cambridgeshire Animal Park.</p>
<p>Upon my arrival, I learn that Scotty the West African Giraffe is lonely. “Why don’t I adopt a companion for him?” my advisor asks. I select Oliver the baby West African Giraffe. He is delivered in a crate by a magnificent helicopter.</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-MCWbD2kpW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I have found purpose. Oliver breathes new life into my mission to steward my animal companions. He wobbles on his tiny legs, and frolics around Large Savannah 2.</p>
<p>With my budget now at 50,000 Zollars, I am invited to invest in a Zoo Keeper Center. Might I finally be able to hire some staff to help me? And some fellow animal lovers to talk to? I hire Bonnie. Derik. Miguel.</p>
<p>Suddenly there is life in this zoo. We are a seamless team. I begin making much needed improvements to the crucial zoo infrastructure. A balloon and souvenir shop is erected near the Pale-Throated Three Toed Sloth exhibit. Burger Barn, strategically, is opened next to our extremely popular Asiatic Lion exhibit. Our zoo’s operating budget has doubled since I began my reign. I build a Breeding Center.</p>
<p>I discover a new feature of my world: I can, at my will, command myself to leave the confines of my body and view the entirety of my zoo at once. I am told later by my advisor that this is “Tycoon View.”</p>
<p>I purchase a motorized buggy to travel across the vast expanse of my zoo estate. I can reach the Tundra Small 01 from Rainforest Medium 02 in 30 seconds.</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Yj0cKB4aQCg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In a cruel twist of fate, Oliver is taken from me. Between upgrading the restrooms and starting an advertising campaign for this troubled park, I seem to have neglected poor Olver. The same helicopter that brought him swiftly ushers him away.</p>
<p>I sink into despair.</p>
<p><i>Review of Zoo Tycoon™, for Xbox One®, the all-in-one games and entertainment system from Microsoft. February 18th, 2014.</i></p>
<p><em>Available exclusively at Wal-Mart.</em></p>
<p><i>————</i></p>
<p>For this four-hour challenge, I wanted to experiment with the genres of review, critique, and humor. I played this game for 2 hours, while pausing to write notes about the narrative arc of my play. I recorded and stored gameplay using the Xbox Game DVR feature, which allows you to record the previous 30 seconds of gameplay. I filmed the stored video clips with my phone because you need to purchase a subscription from Xbox to allow you to upload the video elsewhere.</p>
<p>My main challenge with this piece was to use humor and a fictional narrative while still conveying factual information about the game. If I had more time to work on this, I would have sharpened the critique of simulation games in general a little bit more.</p>

			<p>As a kid I would hide under the covers as a child playing Pokemon Red on my Gameboy. Gaming was occasionally social but mostly solitary. Almost two decades later, I&#8217;m returning to Pokemon with 84,000 other people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon">Twitch Plays Pokemon</a> is a collaborative gaming &#8220;social experiment&#8221; on Twitch.tv, a streaming video platform. Viewers gives commands to control a single character in order to capture Pokemon and acquire badges. Created on Feburary 13th, 2014, the peaked at over 100,000 concurrent viewers and has ten million total views.</p>
<div id="attachment_3675" style="width: 1236px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TPP_Fullscreen.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3675" class=" wp-image-3675 " alt="TPP_Fullscreen" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TPP_Fullscreen.png" width="1226" height="719" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TPP_Fullscreen.png 1226w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TPP_Fullscreen-300x175.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TPP_Fullscreen-1024x600.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TPP_Fullscreen-500x293.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3675" class="wp-caption-text">The Twitch Plays Pokemon Feed. Note that the right-hand chat moves at an incomprehensible velocity, though some players have developed a way to filter commands to see strategic comments. (http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/1y2if6/remove_commands_from_chat_even_more_improved/).</p></div>
<p>The anonymous Australian creator <a href="http://badatvideogames.net/2014/02/16/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-twitchplayspokemon/">shared in an interview</a> the technical details behind the experiment. Pokemon Red (151 ROMhack version) is mounted on the VisualBoyAdvance emulator. An IRC bot lists to button commands on the stream&#8217;s chat, which are then input into the emulator and shown on the stream&#8217;s overlay.</p>
<p>This mixture of javascript and python code allows us to address the question: how does collaboration scale? The flurry of commands on the right translates into game input depending on the voting mode, which itself is determined by votes. In anarchy mode, all commands are input at a rate of about one per second. In democracy mode, the most popular command is input every few seconds.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve given it a shot, but what started as a minute of nostalgia gave way to an hour of frustratingly walking around the same plaza. In sixty minutes, we moved about ten steps and transitioned from anarchy to democracy to anarchy. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_IA4f_D_Osv8hg6JXz9h70zNMN4mkfAk">Time-lapse clips</a> document other stretches of time making no progress.</p>
<p>So why are tens of thousands of people playing? The friend introducing me to Twitch Plays Pokemon stated his motivations: &#8220;I thought this was an simple but powerful concept. Definitely a good way to spend a couple of minutes.&#8221; When asked about his expectations for the outcome of the experiment, he replied &#8220;It will be painful, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they beat the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miraculously, the community <em>has</em> progressed through the game. A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ka89uCBeLl9VV5GPlAKuW7yF8FGtnVmdbPnIwG8FnQ4/preview?sle=true">Google Document </a>recording current progress shows that the community has achieved four of eight badges and trained a decent set of Pokemon. <a href="http://kotaku.com/how-people-are-actually-making-progress-in-twitch-play-1525261786">An article</a> on gaming blog Kotaku illustrates some strategies that players have developed to progress and counteract trolls, players that are intentionally counter-productive.</p>

<p>What started as a small dedicated gathering turned into a large community sharing strategies, frustrations, and experiences. The experiment may not answer questions outright, but forces users to consider the merit of consensus-based rule and the role of trolls. And whether the experiment will triumph or fizzle out, we&#8217;ll test mathematician Émile Borel&#8217;s remark: “With an infinite number of monkeys and an infinite number of typewriters, one will type Shakespeare&#8217;s plays.&#8221;</p>

			<p>SOS Honey Bees</p>
<p>In my 4-hours challenge I wanted to tell the story of the decline of honey bees and why it is so important for nature, human health and economy. Researching and writing this story would have taken me no more than two hours, but instead of that I&#8217;ve researched and presented my story with an info graphic, the first one I&#8217;ve done in my life. So I spent around an hour doing research about this topic and around three hours working on the info graphic with Venngage. I&#8217;ve used photos that I already had, and I am not totally unsatisfied with the result taking into account that this is the first time I communicate something in this way.</p>

			<p>For this assignment I decided to write a story- the type of story I would like to see more of- using SchoolsMap, the platform I&#8217;m building (all the schools in the world, on one map). My goal for SchoolsMap is to show data and facilitate communication about education systems around the globe.<a style="color:black;text-decoration:none" href="http://www.airjordanretrossneaker.com/">cheap air jordan</a></p>
<p>I started by asking a simple question, <em>How can we compare education systems in 3 countries, such as China, Kenya, and the US?</em></p>
<p>You can view the first post at <a href="http://schoolsmap.com">http://schoolsmap.com/</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hours 0-1</span>: spent finding interesting comparative education data. I used the <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx">World Bank Data Query</a> but unfortunately lots of data was unavailable (such as per pupil expenditures in Kenya and China). I also checked the <a href="http://stats.uis.unesco.org">UNESCO Institute for Statistics</a> and tried to find comparative test scores (PISA scores were unavailable for Kenya and China).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hours 1-2</span>: spent analyzing the data. I copied some of the interesting data points into excel and created a few charts. At first I wanted the charts to show trends, but for the data I chose to analyze, historical data was even less available than snapshot data was <a style="color:black;text-decoration:none" href="http://www.cheapairmaxsneakersale.com/">cheap air max</a><br />
.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hours 2-3</span>: spent figuring out mapping tools. I tried to find an easy mapping tool that would allow me to create a heat map or annotated map linked to data. I couldn&#8217;t find a great option and ended up choosing ZeeMaps- you can see my map with the data for Kenya, China, and the US <a href="http://www.zeemaps.com/view?group=854706&amp;x=42.579401&amp;y=36.738799&amp;z=16">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hours 3-4</span>: spent writing content for the first post.</p>
<p>Sc<em>hoolsMap is something I will continue to work on this semester and I welcome your involvement- I am particularly seeking people with design and mapping skills <a style="color:black;text-decoration:none" href="http://www.originalnewbalanceoutlet.com/">original new balance</a>. Also, what is a good way to integrate education news into a data &amp; communication map? Thanks!</em></p>

<p><em>Author&#8217;s note: this piece is cross-posted from Tuesday&#8217;s issue of The Tech, and can be found at <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V134/N5/makemit.html">http://tech.mit.edu/V134/N5/makemit.html</a> — I only occasionally write for the news department of The Tech, referred affectionately by its three-letter abbreviation, NUZ. I took a pretty head-on approach to the 4 Hour Challenge, using it as an opportunity to brush up my rusty newswriting skills and actually get something published in the paper.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mechanical engineers flock to hardware hackathon MakeMIT</strong><br />
<em>50 teams, 200 students participate in MakeMIT’s first year</em></p>
<p>Approximately 200 students gathered in Lobdell Dining Hall last Saturday to participate in the first phase of MakeMIT, a hardware hackathon organized by TechX. While the past year has seen college hackathons (including TechX’s very own HackMIT) increase in both scale and number, most of the emphasis has been on software, with few options for non-computer science students to get in on the action.<br />
