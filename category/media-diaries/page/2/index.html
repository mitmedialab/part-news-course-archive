			<p><strong>The big picture</strong></p>
<p>By Tuesday (21st of Feb) early morning, I tracked about 5.5 days of media usage totalling about 46.6 hours. I used 4 distinct sources of technology &#8211; Macbook Air, iPhone, Echo and paper. I used <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard">RescueTime</a> to track usage on my laptop, <a href="https://inthemoment.io/">Moment app</a> to track usage on my phone and my good ol&#8217; brain for the rest.</p>
<p>Using a top down approach, following was my overall media usage broken down by category:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-9108 aligncenter" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.15.29-AM-300x219.png" alt="" width="300" height="219" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.15.29-AM-300x219.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.15.29-AM-411x300.png 411w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.15.29-AM.png 554w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Source: RescueTime, Moment and personal data collected; chart built using Plot.ly</p>
<p>My media usage amounts to about 35% of my day (46.6 hours out of 5.5 days tracked). I spend the rest of my day commuting (without using media), in class, meetings, running errands, socializing, working out and sleeping. Given sleeping forms a third of my day (7 hours per day), my media consumption though significant is not a very bad statistic.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway 1: Multiple media sources form the 35% daily average media usage for a multitude of tasks</em></p>
<p><strong>From the smallest to the largest source of media consumption…</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Echo (daily average ~ 10 minutes)</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9109 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/echo.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="224" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/echo.jpeg 225w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/echo-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>Echo has been primary news source in the last week. I listen to headlines and short articles from NY times, WSJ, BBC and Economist as I get ready for the day.</p>
<p>Usually I try to scroll through my NY times, WSJ and BBC phone apps but the usage has been minimal in the last week.My news app usage varies but I find myself needing 15-20 minutes to go through all my news apps during the morning but I haven’t allotted the time since being back to school. I usually listen to news podcasts (economist and WSJ) on my walk to school, but given the snow / weekends my podcast listening has been non-existent.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway 2: Consume news (mostly headlines) during commute / multi-tasking</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Print Media (daily average ~ 1-2 hours)</span></p>
<p>My print media usage is usually restricted for class readings – articles and cases. Given I am taking 5 courses this semester, all of which are qualitative, it makes sense to read 1-2 hours on a daily basis to prepare for my average 2 classes per day.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway 3: Print media restricted for coursework ~ associating print with serious media consumption</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">iPhone (daily average ~ 1.6 hours)</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9110 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/iphone.jpeg" alt="" width="259" height="194" />While on average my iPhone usage is around 1.6 hours per week, following is a snapshot of my phone usage for a single day which is reflective of my day-day consumption. I learnt a lot about my phone usage habits and they were pretty consistent with my love of productivity and addictive Instagram usage habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Moment app on my iPhone, I was able to track app usage by minute, location and time of day. Following is a snapshot for last Monday (20th Feb):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9111 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/moment1-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/moment1-169x300.jpg 169w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/moment1-576x1024.jpg 576w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/moment1.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p>1. Throughout the day, I check my phone 60 times, that means on average once every 17 minutes (excluding 7 hours for uninterrupted sleep time) &#8230; clearly a sign of addiction. I used the phone, per check, anywhere from 2 minutes to 44 minutes with a median of 3 minutes, which reflects my fairly short attention span.</p>
<p>2. Home screen &#8211; I spend majority of my time using the home and lock screen, which is where I receive alerts from my various news apps. This indicates my sad habit of consuming news headlines in terms of alerts (I mostly get updates from news apps and outlook and check my phone periodically as my phone is always on night mode).</p>
<p>3. Productivity, productivity, productivity apps – sweat, outlook, weather, notes, app store – my focus has been on working out, emailing / checking calendar, taking quick notes, checking weather and getting more apps to improve my productivity. I am not surprised or shocked by the usage numbers given I feel I am at a minimal time per app.</p>
<p>4. Social networking – Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp &#8211; my Instagram usage is alarming. I have a preference for visual media consumption especially given my interest in following influencers in food, travel, health and fitness space. I feel Instagram is best suited to connect with influencers and brands I like.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway 4: Spend time reading in-depth investigative news articles rather than consuming news updates</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Macbook (daily average ~ 3.8 hours)</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-9114 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mac-300x168.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></p>
<p>I primarily love using my laptop the most because of the screen space and find it most convenient to use the laptop for both work and entertainment.</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: center">Too much entertainment &#8211; According to my RescueTime dashboard, I spend 40% of my time on entertainment and rest on more productive applications like outlook and excel. Following is a screenshot of my overall usage last week by top applications used:<img class="size-medium wp-image-9117 aligncenter" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-9.28.00-PM-300x112.png" alt="" width="300" height="112" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-9.28.00-PM-300x112.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-9.28.00-PM-768x288.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-9.28.00-PM-500x187.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-9.28.00-PM.png 1009w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Source: RescueTime dashboard</li>
<li style="text-align: left">Timeline analysis &#8211; I created the following heatmap for my three main categories (entertainment, communication and design) to understand my hourly usage patterns across the last few days. The richer the color, the more time spent in that category.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-9168 aligncenter" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.22.53-PM-300x117.png" alt="" width="300" height="117" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.22.53-PM-300x117.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.22.53-PM-768x301.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.22.53-PM-1024x401.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.22.53-PM-500x196.png 500w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.22.53-PM.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Source: RescueTime data; heatmap built with excel</p>
<p>My main takeaway from my usage indicates that I have productive work hours from 9 am till 8 pm and during the rest of the time I waste my time consuming Netflix for entertainment purposes.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway 5: Give up Netflix!!!!</em></p>
<p>Overall, I notice my media consumption is very self-centered in serving my own interests. I would be curious to learn how to a non-participatory citizen, such as myself, to be influenced by subjects outside my interest areas and how these topics could enrich my life.</p>

			<p>I am going to focus on one insight I gained out of my media diary, in particular – I was shocked by the magnitude of hours I spend on listening to audio! I spent more time listening to podcasts this week than non-class activities for school (readings, research, and completing assignments).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9153" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.09.18-PM.png" alt="" width="1878" height="1041" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.09.18-PM.png 1878w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.09.18-PM-300x166.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.09.18-PM-768x426.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.09.18-PM-1024x568.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.09.18-PM-500x277.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1878px) 100vw, 1878px" /></p>
<p>Looking back, it does make some sense. I put on NPR every morning when I wake up, and whenever I can manage to listen to a podcast, I have one on. I consider listening to podcasts the perfect activity for multitasking when I am not mentally busy, but I can’t use my hands or look at a screen. I listen to podcasts when I am commuting anywhere (i.e. walking to and from class), cleaning, cooking, running, and getting ready to leave the house. I don’t remember the last time I applied eyeliner without a podcast playing in the background.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9149" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.07.40-PM.png" alt="" width="1087" height="990" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.07.40-PM.png 1087w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.07.40-PM-300x273.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.07.40-PM-768x699.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.07.40-PM-1024x933.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-10.07.40-PM-329x300.png 329w" sizes="(max-width: 1087px) 100vw, 1087px" /></p>
<p>Because I listen to so much content this way, I thought I would dig into the kind of audio I am consuming, and I created the chart above. I am listening to more news and politics than anything else. I don&#8217;t think this is a bad thing, since it is the most realistic way that I will listen to more long-form journalism. I spent a few hours reading long articles through my Pocket suggestions and my print subscription of the New Yorker, but other than that and audio, I mostly get my news through my Twitter feed.</p>
<p>The problem I see from the chart is that I only listened to three audio sources in the news and politics category in the past week, and all of them are distributed by NPR. A big takeaway is that I need to work on diversifying the types of podcasts and audio I listen to for the news.</p>
<p>Please comment below with your favorite podcasts, news or otherwise!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I set up Rescue Time after our first MAS.700 class (February 8) and tracked my time through February 21. I entered offline time, trying to be especially diligent when the time was dedicated to media consumption. For example, during this time period I spent a considerable amount of time reading actual print media for another course I am taking.</p>
<p>I found Rescue Time to be fairly accurate, though I had to customize and clean up the data. I removed times that were idle (i.e., new browser tab, login screen).</p>
<p>A day-by-day comparison of top activities reveals Facebook is the top single time consuming activity.</p>
<div id="attachment_9099" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9099" class="size-large wp-image-9099" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-3.43.10-PM-1-1024x489.png" alt="Comparison of Media by Day" width="584" height="279" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-3.43.10-PM-1-1024x489.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-3.43.10-PM-1-300x143.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-3.43.10-PM-1-768x367.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-3.43.10-PM-1-500x239.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9099" class="wp-caption-text">Comparison of Media by Day</p></div>
<p>When I customized the categories in Rescue Time to reflect their productivity value, the data revealed a shocking amount of time is spent on social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). Perhaps it shouldn’t be that surprising, but seeing it displayed in a bar graph, provided visual confirmation of my suspicion.</p>
<div id="attachment_9098" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9098" class="size-large wp-image-9098" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.00.48-PM-1-1024x397.png" alt="Media by Productivity Categories" width="584" height="226" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.00.48-PM-1-1024x397.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.00.48-PM-1-300x116.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.00.48-PM-1-768x298.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.00.48-PM-1-500x194.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9098" class="wp-caption-text">Media by Productivity Categories</p></div>
<p>The visual display of my “productive activities” showed a fairly high amount of engagement spread across a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>Another useful visual is the output of productive versus non-productive engagement by time of day. My productive time, which includes reading, research, and writing occurs between 2:00pm and 10:00pm. There is a large spike in social media use around midnight or 1:00am, during which time no actual work occurs. Additionally, I often have some type of video streaming simultaneously at this time. This content ranges from news reports to comedy clips to TV shows.</p>
<div id="attachment_9093" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9093" class="size-large wp-image-9093" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.01.30-PM-1024x308.png" alt="Media Consumption by Time of Day" width="584" height="176" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.01.30-PM-1024x308.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.01.30-PM-300x90.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.01.30-PM-768x231.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-21-at-6.01.30-PM-500x150.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9093" class="wp-caption-text">Media Consumption by Time of Day</p></div>
<p>This was a useful graph as it helps me understand how my schedule breaks down. I would have hypothesized that my most productive time actually began around 10:00am, but it turns out that time is spent on email and scheduling—time that is spent using gmail, google calendar, and other similar tools.</p>
<p>I come away from this experiment with two commitments. First, I would like to cut my communication time in the morning from two hours to one hour. My second goal will be to reduce my overall social media time, especially during the window of time before I go to sleep.</p>
<p>I will repeat to myself, “there’s no such thing as multitasking” and try to avoid losing efficiency by working on unrelated topics at the same time.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From Sunday 2/12/2017 to Saturday 2/18/2017, I tracked my media consumption with RescueTime on my laptop, RescueTime on my phone, and logging time by hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how RescueTime and my discrete hand-logged records claim I spent my time:</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-9064 " src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Communication2FScheduling-1.png" width="491" height="491" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Communication2FScheduling-1.png 800w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Communication2FScheduling-1-150x150.png 150w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Communication2FScheduling-1-300x300.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Communication2FScheduling-1-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my own logs showed the real picture.  With my laptop, a second monitor at home, my phone, and countless apps, I’m constantly multitasking, or at the very least, switching between activities.  </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9065" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/My-Multi-tasking-Problem-3.png" alt="" width="496" height="1223" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I send my friends excerpts from news articles as I read, providing (unasked for) running commentary.  I run Netflix in the background as I plan out my day in Google Calendar on my second monitor.  I read a case for class, and WhatsApp notifications pop up on my phone, so of course I check them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While listening to music on my phone and walking to class, I scroll through Facebook, see an interesting article posted by someone I vaguely remember from summer camp a decade ago, Gchat the link to my friend from college, and start chatting about it, continuing throughout the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I originally thought this would be a lesson about distractions and lack of depth in media consumption, but it&#8217;s instead about the discussions.  Over the last year, I was oddly proud of myself for actively trying to see other perspectives by actively clicking on Facebook links posted by people with different ideologies.  But that isn’t sufficient — there’s a difference between simply consuming information and being immersed in discussion about that information.</span></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9053 alignright" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/remember-nothing.gif" alt="" width="350" height="188" />I had a suspicion going into this assignment that I&#8217;ve developed a few really bad media consumption habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>I spend too much time on Twitter, which is skewing my perception of news coverage.</li>
<li>I &#8220;graze&#8221; way too much, opting for reading headlines instead of reading stories. This means I&#8217;m much less informed than I think.</li>
<li>My desire to be constantly &#8220;in the know&#8221; means I almost compulsively check social media first thing in the morning, throughout the day and last thing at night, so it&#8217;s more difficult to balance my media diet.</li>
</ul>
<p>After tracking my media consumption from Feb. 15 through Feb. 20, I can confirm all of these three bad habits are true. The problems may actually be underrepresented, given that this period was a fairly atypical week (as I&#8217;ll explain).</p>
<p>Because I wanted to track media consumption across multiple platforms, I opted not to use RescueTime and noted everything manually in a Google Spreadsheet as the week went on. I cross-checked entries with my Google calendar, browsing history and Twitter history to make sure I wasn&#8217;t missing anything. I didn&#8217;t count reading email, unless there was some specific content there that fit the definition of &#8220;media&#8221; (a newsletter, for example).</p>

<p>The first big finding is pretty glaring: Social media accounts for nearly a third of the time I spend consuming media. Break that down further, and you can see that within the social media category, Twitter takes a lot of the air out of the room.</p>

<p>Twitter is followed by Reddit, which I mostly consume at night before I go to sleep (I also need to cut down on how long I play video games, an issue I blame solely on<a href="http://stardewvalley.net/"> Stardew Valley</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a concerted effort over the last few weeks to spend less time on Facebook, which is why it appears so small in the chart.</p>
<p>One thing to note about the time period recorded: Over the long weekend, I took an out-of-town trip with friends to a spot without great Internet service. I suspect that if I were to repeat the media diary for the next few weeks, there&#8217;d be even more Twitter usage, although this may be offset by more media consumption in general.</p>
<p>If I had to guess before taking a closer look at the numbers, I would have said I spend far more time consuming media by phone than by laptop. That&#8217;s clearly untrue.</p>
<style type="text/css">
       .errordiv { padding:10px; margin:10px; border: 1px solid #555555;color: #000000;background-color: #f8f8f8; width:500px; }#advanced_iframe_3 {visibility:visible;opacity:1;}#ai-layer-div-advanced_iframe_3 p {height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}</style><script type="text/javascript">  var ai_iframe_width_advanced_iframe_3 = 0;  var ai_iframe_height_advanced_iframe_3 = 0;var aiIsIe8=false;var aiOnloadScrollTop="true";

function resizeCallbackadvanced_iframe_3() {}function aiChangeUrl(loc) {}</script><script type="text/javascript"></script>
<p>Also of note: I despise online video. Although I didn&#8217;t graph this particular breakout, almost all the video I consume is through the TV (in this case a Roku stick), and not through mobile or laptop. And although I do often listen to podcasts, NPR or other broadcast media, I didn&#8217;t really do that over this time period.</p>
<p>So despite some data collection problems, it&#8217;s pretty clear I&#8217;ve got some media consumption issues I want to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend less time on social media &#8212; specifically Twitter.</li>
<li>Seek out platforms that use more than just immediacy as the driver for news judgement: Instead of the &#8220;happening now&#8221; on Twitter, find what news editors think is important on the home pages of local and national news organizations.</li>
<li>Change the nighttime routine: Use the evening to read physical media or dive deeper into stories flagged online earlier in the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two tools I think will help are <a href="http://nuzzel.com/">Nuzzel</a>, which alerts you to stories being shared often in your timeline, and <a href="https://getpocket.com/a/">Pocket</a>, which allows you to save stories and other content you see through either your mobile device or laptop to read later. I&#8217;ve already signed up for these services, but I don&#8217;t use them often enough to help me consume more content, instead of just reading headlines.</p>

			<p>In tracking my media usage for the week, I gained something that I imagine most people gain when engaging in this exercise: anxiety. Anxiety and paranoia that I have stopped paying attention to what media I was being exposed to / exposing myself to, that there were aspects of my media consumption that I was significantly less aware of, or that I was generally unconscious of the majority of my consumption on a daily basis. In other words, it worked.</p>
<p>My strategy for designing my media journal was not simply to find out how often I was accessing media, but to develop an ontology for engaging with media and test it to see what properties of media access were the most revelatory about my habits. What follows is a breakout by each of those properties, some of which are revelatory, and some of which might benefit from collecting over a longer timeline.</p>
<p>First, I categorized my media consumption by what it was about. One thing about recording this was that it drew attention to how frequently I was consuming more than one form of media at the same time. Obviously the largest category, music, was mostly consumed while also engaging with a number of the others. It is no surprise to me that work and social are among the biggest categories, but it was surprising just how large of a percentage was dedicated to art (and Instagram, which I struggled to categorize given that it is a platform with multiple types of content; I went with &#8220;social;art&#8221;, since my primary use for it is to follow artists and designers).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7935 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-6.png" alt="image-6" width="777" height="462" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-6.png 777w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-6-300x178.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-6-768x457.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-6-500x297.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></p>
<p>One of the aspects of the journaling I was most interested in was how much media consumption was a choice vs. forced on me by context and environment. Admittedly, I am likely to have dramatically underreported the media I was involuntarily exposed to. Reflecting on walking through the city, it already occurs to me that e.g. I stood in front of a number of advertisements on the back wall of the subway platform that I was subconsciously aware of, but which didn&#8217;t rise to the level of conscious consumption. That said, I do thing what I realized from this process is that, for the media I am at least partially engaged with, most of it is quite purposeful. Non-discretionary is listed, as some media, such as presentations, or readings for classwork were voluntary, but not optional/assigned by others. (This chart is based on number of engagements, not amount of time spent on each piece of media. If this were based on time, it would look dramatically different, skewing toward nondiscrentionary.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7936 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-5.png" alt="image-5" width="777" height="371" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-5.png 777w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-5-300x143.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-5-768x367.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-5-500x239.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></p>
<p>Media type gives a bit more resolution in terms of what I was consuming. What was surprising for me was the variety. If I was to imagine the various types of media I was engaging with on a daily basis, I would have guessed perhaps only 3-4, but it appears there is still diversity in the ways I consume media. Again, advertisements are not broken out here, which might have been interesting. A stand-out is the &#8220;platform&#8221; category, which represents types such as Twitter, Instagram, Instant Messaging platforms, etc. bringing into focus the amount of times I engage with media in an ecosystem where I am likely to be exposed to many other types of content.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7937 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-4.png" alt="image-4" width="776" height="532" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-4.png 776w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-4-300x206.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-4-768x527.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-4-438x300.png 438w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /></p>
<p>I tracked what channels the media I consumed came to me from. No surprise that I&#8217;m the top culprit here in terms of choosing to expose myself to media. Community, friends, and classes are about on equal footing, but on a long enough timeline, I&#8217;d be curious to see how this actually played out. My suspicion is that class would spike and the influence of my friends or online communities would stay mostly the same. (I recently purposefully locked myself out of Facebook and handed the keys to a trusted friend, so it was an interesting time for me to journal. I shudder to think what these charts would look like if my usual habits of being tempted into admittedly a lot of good, yet likely superfluous content.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7938 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-3.png" alt="image-3" width="981" height="371" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-3.png 981w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-3-300x113.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-3-768x290.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-3-500x189.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></p>
<p>The amount of social media content here is alarming, even without Facebook. I think that if I spent more time counting the various exposures during class time (when I appropriately wasn&#8217;t diverting my attention to log every item) this would balance out with social, or at least that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to tell myself&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7939 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-2.png" alt="image-2" width="841" height="500" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-2.png 841w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-2-300x178.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-2-768x457.png 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-2-500x297.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></p>
<p>In terms of what devices this media is experienced through, I would have expected that &#8220;laptop&#8221; would have dominated my phone accesses much more. Another comparison I&#8217;m going to continue to keep my eye on. Again, this is not based on time spent on engaging with the media, so this chart would likely skew toward &#8220;laptop&#8221; given the amount of times I use it to read long-form items, which I can&#8217;t stomach via my phone. At the same time, if I added up every one of the micro-engagements I had on my phone, it&#8217;s <em>possible</em> the gap would be smaller than I&#8217;m imagining.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7940 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-7.png" alt="image" width="752" height="371" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-7.png 752w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-7-300x148.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-7-500x247.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></p>
<p>In general, I think the voluntary/involuntary comparison and source of media analyses were the most educational in understanding my own habits of consumption. No doubt, even tracking a handful of metrics for a short time period heightened my conscious awareness of the beginning of an interaction with a given form of media dramatically.</p>

<p>I did something a little different for my &#8220;media&#8221; diary. Rather than track what &#8220;goes into my head&#8221; via digital media, I tracked what goes into my head &#8212; and out of it &#8212; via <strong>non-digital conversation. </strong></p>
<p>Why would I do such a thing?</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m really interested in exploring the work conversation does to unite us, teach us, and help us co-create knowledge and understanding, now that it&#8217;s so easy for people to speak and be heard.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m convinced that journalists could gain a lot from guiding and even leading public conversations around the news wherever they happen &#8212; as could society at large.</li>
<li>And as for my focus on tracking my non-digital, rather than digital, conversation: Sometimes a cool way to learn what something is is to look at what it isn&#8217;t. Digital conversation gets criticized &#8212; hastily, I think &#8212; for being less immersive, building less empathy, etc., than non-digital conversation. To the extent that&#8217;s true, what can we do to bring more of the strengths of in-person conversation to the digital world? Taking a close look at our own conversations might help us figure that out.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here&#8217;s what I did, and what I learned:</p>
<p><strong>Tracking non-digital &#8220;conversations&#8221;</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_7898" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7898" class="size-medium wp-image-7898" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DataCollection500-225x300.jpg" alt="Here's one of the 9 sheets I used to track, by hand, each and every non-digital conversation I had over three days" width="225" height="300" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DataCollection500-225x300.jpg 225w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DataCollection500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7898" class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s one of the 9 sheets I used to track, by hand, each and every non-digital conversation I had over three days</p></div>
<p>For the purposes of my tracking, I defined a &#8220;conversation&#8221; as an exchange among myself and at least one other person in which we all use our actual voices to speak. So in-person and telephone conversations are in, but tweets and emails are out.</p>
<p>For each and every separate conversation I documented over the waking hours of three days (Feb. 11, Feb. 12 and Feb. 15), I tracked a bunch of stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>duration (in minutes)</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>whether we talked to each other in person or not (y/n)</li>
<li>whether the conversation was specifically scheduled (y/n)</li>
<li>how well I know the other participants (0-5, with 0 = not at all and 5 = they&#8217;re family)</li>
<li>whether I knew the participant&#8217;s names</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are key:</p>
<ul>
<li>how <strong>immersed</strong> I was in the conversation (0-5, with 0 = barely paying attention and 5 = nothing else matters)</li>
<li>how much I felt the conversation built on the <strong>relationship</strong> between myself and whoever I was speaking to (0-5, with 0 = not at all and 5 = hugely bonded)</li>
<li>how much I <strong>enjoyed</strong> the conversation (0-5, with 0 = not at all and 5 = tremendously)</li>
<li>how much enduring <strong>knowledge</strong> I got from the conversation  (0-5, with 0 = none and 5 = tons)</li>
</ul>
<p>I collected information on 169 separate conversations.</p>
<p><strong>And here&#8217;s what I got, by the numbers&#8230;</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_7975" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7975" class="size-full wp-image-7975" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ThreeDays.png" alt="Most of my conversations were under 5 minutes long.

The longest conversations happened while people were sitting still: a meeting over coffee, another over lunch, a dinner with friends, and catching up with my husband at the end of the day.</p></div>
<p>THE BASICS</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>42 percent</strong> of the time I was awake, I was in conversation</li>
<li>The average conversation lasted <strong>6.6 minutes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Half</strong> my conversations clocked in at under a minute, while only <strong>10 percent</strong> lasted 30 minutes or more. Those shorter conversations went by fast, though: They accounted for just <strong>0.3 percent </strong>of the total time I spent in conversation</li>
<li><strong>1 of every 10</strong> of my conversations were with strangers whose names I didn&#8217;t know (waiters, cashiers, etc.). But they, too, were quick, making up just <strong>0.7 percent</strong> of my total conversation time</li>
<li>I spent <strong>516 minutes</strong> &#8212; <strong>44 percent</strong> of my total conversation time &#8212; talking to just the three members of my immediate family: my husband, my 3-year-old son, and my baby daughter. Unsurprisingly, <strong>a third</strong> of my conversations took place at home.</li>
<li>All but <strong>12</strong> of these non-digital conversations happened in person. Eleven were phone conversations, and one was an online podcast interview</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7977" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ConvoDur.png" alt="ConvoDur" width="600" height="371" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ConvoDur.png 600w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ConvoDur-300x186.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ConvoDur-485x300.png 485w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>CONVERSATION AT WORK</p>
<p>I was extra curious about the three scales on which I measured the work my conversations were doing &#8212; <strong>relationship building</strong>, <strong>enjoyment</strong>, and <strong>knowledge building</strong> &#8212; and to what extent they were related to a conversation&#8217;s <strong>duration</strong>, or how <strong>immersed</strong> I felt I was in each one.</p>
<p>These were subjective, self-reported scales, and fairly uncalibrated. But just for fun, here&#8217;s the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>I spent <strong>70 percent</strong> of my conversation time in discussions I really enjoyed, in <strong>37 exchanges</strong> I rated a 4 or 5 on the enjoyment scale</li>
<li>I spent <strong>15 percent</strong> of my conversation time in discussions that significantly built on my relationships, in just <strong>five exchanges</strong> I rated a 4 or 5 on the relationship scale, <strong>all</strong> of whom I also rated a 4 or 5 on enjoyment</li>
<li>I spent <strong>24 percent</strong> of my conversation time in discussions where I felt I learned a significant amount, rated 4 or 5 on the knowledge building scale. Only <strong>six conversations</strong> met this high bar &#8212; and <strong>five of these six</strong> were also rated 5 on the enjoyment scale</li>
<li>For reference: On average, I rated my conversations a <strong>2.6 on immersion</strong>, a<strong> 1.6 on relationship building</strong>, a<strong> 2.5 on enjoyment </strong>and a<strong> 0.4 on knowledge building</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the fun part. Did longer conversations correlate with higher grades on these scales? How about conversations in which I felt more immersed in the conversation itself, with less preoccupying or distracting me?</p>
<p>Here are a few charts to illustrate an answer to those questions. I claim no statistical significance here, but you can see some trends &#8212; especially when you compare immersion with enjoyment&#8230;</p>

<p>SOME TAKEAWAYS:</p>
<p>Just from a walking-around-in-my-own-body standpoint, there&#8217;s no question to me, having done this, that I get more out of conversations when I&#8217;m able to focus on them, and on the people I&#8217;m talking to. That&#8217;s really hard, though, and the rewards of great conversations are more rare than I realized.</p>
<p>I do a lot of other things while I talk to people. Walking around, taking notes, eating, looking something up on my phone &#8230; Many of my conversations fit in the transitional periods between other activities.</p>
<p>But many of my most enjoyable, longest lasting and knowledge building conversations stayed still somehow. A lunch with a student who inspires me. A one-hour reading lesson with my son. A family dinner at my best friend&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another interesting tidbit: Of the 169 conversations I tracked over these three days, 15 had been formally scheduled to happen (coffee meetings, a lunch, an interview, etc.). Those I rated, on average, <strong>4.1 on immersion</strong>, <strong>2.9 on relationship building, 4.2 on enjoyment and 2.5 on knowledge building</strong> &#8212; far higher than the total conversation averages listed above.</p>
<p>The attention economy, indeed&#8230;</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This post is about two things: 1) The arbitrariness of the ways in RescueTime (and I!) define media and 2) the realization that I really need to spend far, far less time looking at screens. (Far, <em>far </em>less.)</p>
<p>I used RescueTime to track my media consumption, but then threw that data into buckets. A few attempts to wrestle through some of the questions I found interesting, below.</p>
<p><strong>News, Entertainment &amp; Social</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7859 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NEShd-300x241.jpg" alt="NEShd" width="300" height="241" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NEShd-300x241.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NEShd-768x616.jpg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NEShd-1024x821.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NEShd-374x300.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This first rough slice looks at three categories: the time I spent on news, social and entertainment. I used these categories because RescueTime uses them, but I already see ample space for confusion and critique. We&#8217;re already playing in somewhat arbitrary territory, in the sense that the time I spent on BuzzFeed got classified as news consumption, but could possibly have gone into entertainment (was it a listicle? Was the listicle newsworthy?). Meanwhile, BBC America went into news, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I spent those 11 minutes looking at Doctor Who action figures. On a more substantive note: there is genuine slippage between categories, here. For example, the &#8220;Entertainment&#8221; category includes all of YouTube (I didn&#8217;t track each video separately, but I almost wish I had). Part of that YouTube time was definitely informational videos about gravitational waves, and part of it was &#8220;Last Week Tonight,&#8221; a product that easily belongs in more than one category. Meanwhile, most obviously, &#8220;Social&#8221; is both news and entertainment. In an era when I&#8217;ll see Tweets about an earthquake before it appears in the news, I&#8217;m genuinely getting breaking news off social media (never mind the more hyperlocal &#8216;news&#8217; about my friends&#8217; lives.) Finally: let&#8217;s stop pretending the news and entertainment are separate. I don&#8217;t think that helps anyone.</p>
<p><strong>News, a Breakdown by Source</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7860 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/News-Breakdown-300x242.jpg" alt="News Breakdown" width="300" height="242" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/News-Breakdown-300x242.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/News-Breakdown-768x620.jpg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/News-Breakdown-1024x827.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/News-Breakdown-371x300.jpg 371w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> I found this breakdown interesting. Here I&#8217;ve broken down &#8220;news&#8221; by point of origin, excluding social (ie, FB). The big green slice towards the bottom is blogs. This includes Medium and WordPress sites, and they dwarf any other individual news site. Also, I don&#8217;t know what killed news brand loyalty (search? social?) but it&#8217;s clearly dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Users Versus Big Media </strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7870 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/UGC-vs-Big-Mediahd-300x241.jpg" alt="UGC vs Big Mediahd" width="300" height="241" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/UGC-vs-Big-Mediahd-300x241.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/UGC-vs-Big-Mediahd-768x616.jpg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/UGC-vs-Big-Mediahd-1024x821.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/UGC-vs-Big-Mediahd-374x300.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> In the news and entertainment categories, I thought it would be interesting to look at media based upon who produced it. This is where it all got interesting. The clunky term &#8220;user-generated&#8221; (which still roams at large in many newsrooms) is both off-putting and, it turns out, not very useful. The &#8220;User-generated&#8221; slice here includes everything I watched on YouTube. When I think about the stuff I watch you YT, it includes a ton of Youtube cover bands, makeup tutorials (deal with it), and comedy groups. My point: I spend a lot of time consuming media on YouTube that is produced by neither Big Media nor casual users, but by some in-between professional class of producers whose only distribution mechanism is YouTube. Some of these folks are quite famous, some of them make a comfortable living off what they do on YouTube. But they&#8217;re not part of the group of producers we consider Big Media. Meanwhile, User-gen also includes Reddit, which is some strange and uncomfortable hybrid of user-generated and big media.</p>
<p><strong>User-gen, breakdown</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7876 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/User-Generatedhd-300x241.jpg" alt="User Generatedhd" width="300" height="241" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/User-Generatedhd-300x241.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/User-Generatedhd-768x616.jpg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/User-Generatedhd-1024x821.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/User-Generatedhd-374x300.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This chart demonstrates the weirdness of &#8220;user-generated&#8221; as a term, still further. I&#8217;ve got content from Reddit, Blogs (Medium, Medium&#8217;s <em>Matter </em>publication, etc) and YouTube all jumbled together in here. None of this is produced by &#8216;users&#8217; in isolation &#8211; even platforms like Reddit and YouTube enjoy massive monopolies over particular types of interaction, and they are hardly small players. They provide development, editing and interaction tools on their platforms, thereby participating in the process of content creation. Therefore, the final product, even on a site like Reddit, is partnership-generated. This content <em>isn&#8217;t </em>generated by professional journalists, but we (professional journalists) might be the only people who care about that distinction anymore.</p>
<p><strong>News vs. Telegram</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-7881 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/All-news-vs-One-Social-site-300x243.jpg" alt="All news vs One Social site" width="300" height="243" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/All-news-vs-One-Social-site-300x243.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/All-news-vs-One-Social-site-768x623.jpg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/All-news-vs-One-Social-site-1024x831.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/All-news-vs-One-Social-site-370x300.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong>This chart looks depressing, but it&#8217;s actually possibly vaguely heartening.  Remember up top, when I said I need to spend less time with screens? That&#8217;s true, certainly, but it isn&#8217;t true that screen time =/= relationship time. In this chart, I juxtapose all the time I spent on news this week against the time I spent on Telegram, the social networking site I use the most. Here&#8217;s the interesting part: I only use Telegram to talk to a handful of friends. That means that I spent 6 hours and 52 minutes talking to approximately four friends, online. In a way, this is an homage to relationship-building, isn&#8217;t it? Even when I&#8217;m online, the #1 thing I&#8217;m doing is maintaining relationships with a core group of friends. The most interesting part of all this is that these are the four friends I probably hang out with the most in daily life, too. Interesting? Weird? Cult-ish? Maybe a bit of all three, but at least I feel a little less like an antisocial nutjob.</p>
<p><strong>Print vs. Online</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-7888 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Online-vs.-Print-300x243.jpg" alt="Online vs. Print" width="300" height="243" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Online-vs.-Print-300x243.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Online-vs.-Print-768x622.jpg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Online-vs.-Print-1024x829.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Online-vs.-Print-370x300.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t find the exact quote, but a few months ago a fairly senior official at a big news publisher made headlines (Tweetlines?) by suggesting that young people will one day get tired of consuming news online and will go back to print newspapers. Whoever he is, wherever he is, this chart is for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Video vs. the World</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7893 alignleft" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Video-vs-Rest-300x245.jpg" alt="Video vs Rest" width="300" height="245" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Video-vs-Rest-300x245.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Video-vs-Rest-768x627.jpg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Video-vs-Rest-1024x836.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Video-vs-Rest-368x300.jpg 368w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> This is another one of those charts I kinda struggled with, but it gets at a distinction I wanted to address. Because I&#8217;ve been using RescueTime for a while, very little of what I&#8217;ve discovered this week surprises me. That said, I was reminded just how much time I spend watching video content online. (And it&#8217;s interesting, because despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I still think of myself as a &#8216;reader&#8217;.) What&#8217;s interesting is that this statistic might actually underestimate the amount of time I spend watching video, because it <em>doesn&#8217;t </em>count the time I spent on, say, a Vox media page watching an embedded video on that page. (&#8216;Video&#8217;, here, only counts time on video-specific sites like YouTube or Netflix.) This also raises really interesting questions about video distribution. BuzzFeed makes a ton of money off video. Here&#8217;s a quote from an <a href="http://tktk.gawker.com/internal-documents-show-buzzfeed-s-skyrocketing-investm-1709816353" target="_blank">article</a> about their financial statements:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You have to remember,” Dempsey added, “that BuzzFeed doesn’t operate on any sort of subscription model, is growing at a significantly higher rate versus traditional media companies, and also is doing a lot in their original video content, which is largely viewed outside of BuzzFeed.com, almost making this part of the business more comparable to an original content company vs. digital media publication.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of winning the video play, at least if you&#8217;re taking a page out of the BuzzFeed playbook (and who isn&#8217;t, these days?), is being seen on aggregators like YouTube and Netflix. How many news publishers are serious about building audience on YouTube (I know what you&#8217;re thinking: does John Oliver count?) Meanwhile, if you search Netflix for news, what do you get? Nothing at all.</p>
<p><em>Note: if the image quality on these charts is lame, I&#8217;ve got higher resolution pdfs I can share.</em></p>
