					<description><![CDATA[This is interesting, but I don&#039;t know what the story itself is. (Or maybe you didn&#039;t intend this to be a story, in which case disregard what&#039;s below.) 

How you got the data is impressive to non-tech folks, but if the reader can&#039;t tell WHAT the point is, does the technical scraping process matter? 

Perhaps the &quot;how I did this&quot; could be a footnote to a short, succinct statements that a general audience could understand. Journalists usually write for a general audience but I&#039;d argue that your average reader wouldn&#039;t be able to tell you what those charts say.

Maybe the headline could have been: Nope, not all WebMD roads lead to cancer. (I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s what the headline would be, but that&#039;s just to give you an idea.)]]></description>
