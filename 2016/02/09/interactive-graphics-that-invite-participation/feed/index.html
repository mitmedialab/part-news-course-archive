					<description><![CDATA[Last year in Israel, I went to a few protests that became quite violent. I filmed and took pictures with my phone - sometimes for reporting, sometime just to post on social media - but was always afraid that the people I was filming (police and right-wing thugs) will see me filming and try to snatch my phone. 
That&#039;s why I was very excited to learn about apps that allow journalists and citizen journalists to film with their phone and then send the film to Youtube or to their email automatically. 
Some of the tools available are CopWatch by Darren Batista, which allows you to upload the video and sends an alert to Canadian group &quot;Network for the Elimination of Police Violence&quot;, and CA Justice by ACLU which uploads the videos to their website. My life here have been pretty peaceful so I didn&#039;t get a chance to make use of the apps yet, but they are a very important step in allowing reporters and citizen journalists to document violence, from police or other sources.]]></description>
