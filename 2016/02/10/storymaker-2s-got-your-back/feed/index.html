					<description><![CDATA[This app was designed primarily with citizen journalists in mind and the idea is to capture the action and file the story where and when it happens - hence the mobile approach. The app also leverages tools that mobile phones have, i.e. camera and microphone - with the idea that you capture the footage and process it immediately - so it would not be as effective on desktop devices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is such a cool product! I can&#039;t wait to see it make its way to iOS. 

I&#039;m curious though, why they don&#039;t have a desktop version. In my experience many (most?) journalists work almost exclusively on desktop. Have you used the Android version? How do you feel about the mobile-first approach? Do you think it will still see widespread adoption for establishment types?]]></description>
