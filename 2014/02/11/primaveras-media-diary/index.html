<p>For a more detailed overview of my media consumption, click <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png"><a href="http://www.googlish.com/Media">here</a></a> !<a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3396" alt="media-consume" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png" width="1212" height="565" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume.png 1212w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume-300x139.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume-1024x477.png 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/media-consume-500x233.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">After trying to figure out which tool I could use to track my media consumption, I immediately encountered a problem: I have 3 different computers that I use regularly depending on my location (my old computer which always stays home, my new computer which resides at the Berkman center, and my netbook which always follows me along), 2 phones which I often use to check my emails or skype, and I sometimes rely on analog media, just as books. I could therefore not figure out a single application that would collect data about my media consumption simultaneously on all devices.. so I decided to keep track of it myself. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoCMvT0NORh9dFk5UW82dGMzQnlkN0dXclRhamE5TVE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0">Here</a> is the spreadsheet that came out of it.<br />
In addition to measuring my media consumption, my curiosity brought me to also collect the main topics of consumption. I tried to classify every piece of information that I gathered from media into broad categories, so as to be able to subsequently assess the correlation existing between the media I consume and the type of content or information I get exposed to.<br />
After fiddling with various tools for datavisualisation, I ended up picking up d3.js &#8211; a very powerful tool for creativing beautiful data visualisations in (almost) no time &#8211; at least once you&#8217;ve figured out how to use it.. The current visualisations are not that exciting, of course, but that&#8217;s all I managed to get done for this first attempt at learning the tool.<br />
The result was quite surprising as I realised that my media consumption during the week was limited to a very small number of very specific topics, which are not in fact at all representative of how I perceived my interested to be:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>Art was the great winner, with over 26 hours over the whole week. Of course, this was greatly related to the fact that I spent most of my week working with colleagues on our Burning Man proposal whose deadline is next week, so a large part of my &#8220;Conversations&#8221; this week were related to &#8220;Art&#8221;.</li>
<li>Programming was (surprisingly) the second, with over 10 hours of exposure. This is, in reality, not so surprising, considering that I was actually learning how to use d3 for this very assignment, so I had to spend many hours browsing the web in order to figure out how to achieve my goals.</li>
<li>Science-Fiction was third, also over 10 hours of exposure. I did not expect it at all, since I&#8217;m actually not a Science fiction freak, but then again I am currently reading a science fiction book and I&#8217;ve been watching various Sci-Fi movies that week, so it probably makes sense.</li>
<li>The rest basically amounts to my research topics: surveillance, antitrust, bitcoin, copyright, privacy and mesh networking, which when summed together amount to over 40 hours of exposure during the whole week. A result that did not surprise me at all.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The other interesting result of this analysis was derived the relative proportion of media I have been consuming over the week. Web is naturally the number one (with over 36 hours of consumption), which is not surprising since most of the information I seek comes from the web &#8211; although I did in fact expect my weekly exposure to the Web to be even higher than 36 hours. But what was highly surprising to me was to realize that the &#8220;Web&#8221; medium was so closely followed by &#8220;Conversation&#8221; (with over 33 hours of exposure). Of course, one might argue that &#8220;conversation&#8221; is not a medium in itself.. yet, as I compiled the spreadsheet, I carefully marked down only these conversation that were actually exposing me to new information, or that involved some kind of collaborative information construction.<br />
This made me reflect upon the actual definition of &#8220;media&#8221;. I personally never really thought about what is or is not a medium, in fact, I consider myself to be extremely ignorant as regards media. So this is probably not the proper definition of &#8220;media&#8221;, but according to my personal view, &#8220;media&#8221; is whatever convey information or allow someone to communicate &#8211; which is why I decided to include &#8220;conversations&#8221; whithin the media category.<br />
Overall, I think this was an extremely interesting exercise, which allowed me to become more aware, and to pay more attention to my media consumption. While I think the weekly &#8220;topics&#8221; were slightly biased or contaminated by circumstancial factors, I was happy to discover that &#8220;conversations&#8221; play such an important role in my media consumption. Since I arrived in Boston 3 months ago, I have found myself complaining about how difficult it is to get any work done in such a mentally stimulating environment such as the Berkman Center and the MIT Medialab. Now, I can finally justify it on being one of my main sources of information ;).<br />
I also really enjoyed the process of figuring out how to transform a basic spreadsheet into something meaningful and visually enticing &#8211; which allowed me to discover the potential of d3 as a datavisualisaton tool, and to come back to my somewhat rusty programming skills.</p>

				<div class="comment-content"><p>Primavera &#8211; I love the color palette in your visualizations and I think it&#8217;s especially great that you used the assignment to learn a new technology as well. (Now we know who to call on to lead us in a D3 workshop!) Is the X axis in your visualizations tracking minutes?</p>
<p>I like that you recognized conversations as a media form. It&#8217;s too often overlooked as &#8220;media&#8221; perse but I feel that conversation carries weight that no other social media really does. What I mean is that I&#8217;m much more likely to go check something out based on a real, live conversation with someone (or their mention of something at an event or class) than I am if I simply see someone&#8217;s tweet. Nice work.</p>
