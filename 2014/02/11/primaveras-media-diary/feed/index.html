					<description><![CDATA[Primavera - I love the color palette in your visualizations and I think it&#039;s especially great that you used the assignment to learn a new technology as well. (Now we know who to call on to lead us in a D3 workshop!) Is the X axis in your visualizations tracking minutes?

I like that you recognized conversations as a media form. It&#039;s too often overlooked as &quot;media&quot; perse but I feel that conversation carries weight that no other social media really does. What I mean is that I&#039;m much more likely to go check something out based on a real, live conversation with someone (or their mention of something at an event or class) than I am if I simply see someone&#039;s tweet. Nice work.]]></description>
