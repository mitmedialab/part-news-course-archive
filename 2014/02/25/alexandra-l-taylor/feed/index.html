					<description><![CDATA[This was nicely done; I like that you fact-checked yourself at the beginning of the interview. And I really liked that you extensively discussed your process and struggles in doing the online searches. My favorite parts were about how you dug up the videos of her and how you searched her prior posts from this class for clues. Nice sleuthing!

Also, I hope you are willing to remove Alex&#039;s email address and post it publicly, which Alex says is okay in the video!]]></description>
