					<description><![CDATA[This is great and helpful! Thanks for the step-by-step. It could really use some concrete examples though—I know you didn&#039;t want to show the information about the person you researched but it would be great to see this with a dummy profile of some kind. Lastly, you said you were interested in the question &quot;How much could be automated and done by machines, and which still require humans?&quot; but don&#039;t address it in your write-up. Would love to see your thoughts on that, especially as we move into this data science moment, much driven by advertisers, who want to believe they are able to microtarget people based on very specific information hidden in their digital exhaust.]]></description>
