					<description><![CDATA[I really love this project, it&#039;s definitely a great way to explain a story in one place instead of linking to other pages or overwhelming the reader with a lot of graphics. One thing this project reminded me of is what Tactical Tech did with Exposing the Invisible (https://exposingtheinvisible.org/stories/unseen-war/sadaf/). They have a subtle way of including relevant information to the story as the user is scrolling down the site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so cool! Circa + (optional) context. I&#039;ve been thinking a lot about how the principles of transmedia storytelling can be applied to journalism, in particular the axes of spreadability/drillability. News apps are one way to do this — you show the overall or outlying/interesting takeaways by default as the &quot;spreadable&quot; piece, but you also provide an option for the reader to drill deep and explore content relevant to them (e.g. geographically). At ProPublica, this was called the &quot;far&quot; and the &quot;near.&quot;

FOLD is another approach in including both spreadable/drillable elements in reporting, but for a different kind of story (i.e. where a large data set to provide the near view may not be present). You have the general story broken down and distilled to its most basic parts (the spreadable part — even better if you could implement some way of sharing/embedding that primary column easily), then you have the tangential context that readers can (optionally) drill deep into if they so desire. Very cool piece, looking forward to the final product!]]></description>
