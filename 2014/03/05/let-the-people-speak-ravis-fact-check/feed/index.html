					<description><![CDATA[I like that you are experimenting with Prezi for storytelling and the method of pulling out quotes that (now in retrospect) are clearly false is effective. However one thing I wonder is whether it&#039;s effective and pleasurable simply because it serves to confirm things that we already feel to be true like &quot;politicians lie&quot; or &quot;we can&#039;t trust the media&quot;. Would there be a way to use these quotes to shed light on the present and help us make better decisions?]]></description>
