					<description><![CDATA[Very creative approach to this project, and thank you for showing off some new tools that we can play with for assignments and future journalism. In the same way that you mention the links in the ThingLink interrupt the flow of consuming the piece in its entirety, you also see that when you drop in a lot of social media links into a piece, disrupting the narrative—especially when they aren&#039;t straight quotes but serve as integral parts themselves as many Storify pieces are constructed. 

What&#039;s unclear though is the narrative you are offering. Does this stand on its own or is it a companion piece? I guess this is the &quot;preview&quot; as you put it. Certainly I&#039;m seeing a lot here and the visual nature of the composition draws me in—you picked a strong image. Is this image from her practicing for the tournament you are previewing. Is that the hook?]]></description>
