					<description><![CDATA[Loved this piece and it reads so well! Like Catherine said, I thought I was reading a play-by-play from being in the room. The footnotes allow for it to read well while also attributing the sources. I like that you tried to find reliable sources and quote the more heavily too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great - if I didn&#039;t have the context from the assignment and the tweets referenced at the bottom I would have thought you were reporting from the panel itself. I&#039;m impressed that you were able to glean a play-by-play report in such detail from a single panel. And actually, now I&#039;m wondering if that would be possible for most of the panels at the conference AND if we could write a program/algorithm that would automatically group social media into conference panels as a kind of documentation service.]]></description>
