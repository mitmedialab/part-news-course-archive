					<description><![CDATA[Covering &quot;startups&quot; at SXSW, broadly construed, is quite the task you gave yourself! But also totally doable as long as you grab a slice or try to get a flavor of what the coverage is doing. You seemed to go with the flavor approach, sampling SXSW history and current panels and pitches and marketing. Great that you can get such a broad array of things thanks to the huge amount of social media coverage of this particular event.]]></description>

You might want to check out Julia&#039;s story this week as she also reported on SXSW and tried to give us synopsis of a single panel through the tweets about it:
