					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve put together an impressive collection of social media content around this story; it&#039;s almost overwhelming. It makes me wonder the utility of Storify as a presentation format for this kind of story, as more and more information comes out about the story, you can&#039;t simply add more and more content. There is needs to be a theme or something to tie things together and make me feel like I&#039;ve consumed an whole thing. This is an open question right now around presentation in Circa and other newsapps that are going for both consumable whole as well as infinite scroll kind of article. 

Would love to hear more about how you used all the different collecting tools and thought about the different formats of content when constructing your story.]]></description>
