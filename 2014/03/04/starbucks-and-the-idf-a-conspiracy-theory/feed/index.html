					<description><![CDATA[Nice piece Elissar - I like your use of embedded media and images. What is interesting in this case is that the claim seems to have arisen with a satirical story and that Starbucks has difficulty shaking that. That&#039;s an interesting conundrum (or perhaps opportunity for people looking to promote a particular cause).

A small note - Visually-speaking, I think you could have made the conclusion -- &quot;False&quot; more apparent. Or perhaps there&#039;s an opportunity for a custom graphic of some kind there. It&#039;s worth thinking about how the images and headers for a story will also serve to tell the story without the text.]]></description>
