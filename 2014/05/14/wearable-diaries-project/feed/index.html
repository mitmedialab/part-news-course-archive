					<description><![CDATA[Jeff, I really appreciate how thoughtfully you&#039;ve reacted to feedback through this process. You began with an idea of a fully automated, Glass-driven diary and have ended up somewhere significantly different. I see that as a huge positive - you&#039;ve incorporated feedback from people throughout the process and ended up with a much better user experience (even if not fully implemented) and a great set of lessons learned.

I think the personal diary with voiceover is a very interesting narrative form. I&#039;d love to see some examples of it used for journalistic storytelling and I have every confidence that there are good ways to use it for journalism. Very impressed with where you&#039;ve ended up on this.]]></description>
