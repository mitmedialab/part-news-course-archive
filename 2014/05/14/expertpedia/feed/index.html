					<description><![CDATA[Ravi, I like the idea a great deal. As we discussed in class, other efforts have entered the space, but they&#039;ve quickly been coopted by PR forces - see Profnet. I think this is a tool that&#039;s really designed with reporters in mind. As a result, it raises questions of who will end up paying for it - I can&#039;t imagine reporters being willing to pay much, but perhaps if it becomes part of the suite of tools any professional newsroom needs, there&#039;s a revenue stream there. I think you would want to be careful about letting sources pay, as that&#039;s likely to taint the network in one way or another.

There are countless questions about how an algorithm would work best. I think you took some good first steps in showing how you could retrieve pieces of an entry - the really interesting next step would be to assemble some manual queries for a couple of real-world requests - i.e., pick a few breaking stories, think about who you&#039;d want as a source, and walk through a process to conduct Google Scholar and Google News sources to surface a list of experts, then see how your system did in meeting your needs. Next step is to do the same thing for someone else and react to his/her feedback. All of this will end up shaping the prototype and wireframes, and bringing you closer to something you can propose for funding.

I think this is something that&#039;s a few turns of the crank away from something fundable, but I think you could get closer by tuning the algorithm yourself, manually, before turning it into software. Would be excited to see this go further.]]></description>
