					<description><![CDATA[Julia, I admire and appreciate your dedication to the SchoolsMap project. In conversations, you&#039;ve also persuaded me that SchoolMap, used well, could provide a very helpful complement to education reporting, allowing schools to portray themselves in a way that complements and contextualizes quantitative data. 

For me, the missing piece is the need for a demo of how video could be used by students and by the school to portray themselves, above and beyond your excellent documentary. I think a demo that showed a video produced by students or by a community put in context with the data, and perhaps accompanying a story, would make your point more strongly than the video you close with, which seems like a cool idea, but not entirely related to the one you put forth here.]]></description>
