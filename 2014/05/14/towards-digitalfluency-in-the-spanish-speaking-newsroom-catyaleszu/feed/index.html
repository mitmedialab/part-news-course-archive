I&#039;d love a writeup of lessons learned based on the workshop you ran this past weekend, and I&#039;d particularly appreciate it if you could address some of the questions you got about inclusion/exclusion of non-professional journalists from your set of participants. It&#039;s a really interesting idea and I&#039;d love to see it get some funding and be carried out in the real world.]]></description>
