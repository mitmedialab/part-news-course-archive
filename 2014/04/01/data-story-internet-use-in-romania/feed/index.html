					<description><![CDATA[What a richness of data in this story! You would expect good data on internet coverage and related metrics though. I like that you visualized a series of slices of this data to set up the paradox of high speed and low penetration and follow through how that low penetration affects behaviors.

My favorite graph is the last one. The egovernment data: the activity levels against the average rings really shows this issue well.

A note on presentation: the line graphs are really busy because you have so many countries to compare, which makes them a little hard to read. That could be alleviated with an interactive graph, which has a default view of highlighting the Romanian line and leaving the others slightly desaturated in the background.]]></description>
