					<description><![CDATA[Great questions Julia and nice work on picking up the phone. I think these are great questions to bring to the class and get feedback on. I see stories in many directions - allocation of resources, parents&#039; perspective of selecting/not selecting schools for their kids, kids perspective of being a student, public vs private vs hybrid model questions, and so on. One thing to think about might be coming up with use cases for your database of schools - who does this data matter to? and why? what would they be looking to find out from the data? Off the top of my head I would say it matters to parents, teachers, students, school administrators, policy makers, City of Boston administration. As a next step I might interview some of those people about their existing use of school data (on things like Greatschools.org or municipal data) to see what decisions they try to make with data, what data they wish they had, and so on.]]></description>
