					<description><![CDATA[Sorry about the embed problems, sometimes you need to toggle between editing modes to get iframes to work.

I love the use of the map and important issue you are illustrating with the data. In your last paragraph you tell us what the size of the bubbles and colors on the map indicate, but I jumped to the map before reading the piece and the legend didn&#039;t tell me what those were so I was a bit lost and had to wait until the last paragraph. It would be good to both front-load that information in the article to tell us what your data are indicating. I&#039;m still unclear on the gradient though. 

It would be helpful to give some more context as to how the forms and votes work with regard to election counts in Kenya, so that we can be sufficiently outraged!]]></description>
