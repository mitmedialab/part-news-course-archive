					<description><![CDATA[This is an excellent example of a story and set of actions. Here you take the Solutions Journalism approach by raising our awareness about an ongoing campaign and pointing us to an existing petition. But you also suggest other options for action, appealing to tech- and data-savvy readers to help map the issue; you also call for policymakers to change penal code around webcam child sex tourism. This represents a wide audience of differing powers or capabilities: sign the petition, code something to help with documentation, and change law. I think we want to consider all of those options, but I also wonder if efficacy is blunted with multiple different types of actions in a single document. I honestly don&#039;t know; I&#039;m just thinking aloud here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this. I knew the event. In fact I used it as an example while I taught in Ankara. I did not know about the petition. Somehow I missed that. I added my name now. Thanks. It is so good that you mention also other ways of dealing with the issue, beyond petitions. I wonder to what extent they can be effective.]]></description>
