					<description><![CDATA[This is a classic approach: address people&#039;s mourning and give them the opportunity to take action if they like. I think you bury the potential actions though in your links. There are so many links, some to stories about Anja and some to her photographs, which are great, and then some to ideas for action. I wonder if you maybe helped us visualize ourselves taking action in the article rather than just linking: give us an example of a prayer, or a specific reason to donate to MSF.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very sorry to hear that Ravi and for your loss as well. 
Photographs will remain of course. One could feel her was being full of light when looking at her eyes in her own photos as well.
Still anger remains. Is not there anyone being held responsible?]]></description>
