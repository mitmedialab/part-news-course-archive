					<description><![CDATA[This is great. I like the approach: latest news, why does this matter, how can I do something about it. You explain why donation would help, which is good, and the UNCHR link actually goes to a specific Syrian campaign (FYI: the WFP link is the same right now), which suggests to me that my money is going directly to this issue, so I feel good about that. I like the alternative suggestion as well, but it would be better if you provided the information on how to send a letter to my delegation. I have no idea how to do that or what it should say: so contact information and boilerplate letter text would really help.]]></description>
