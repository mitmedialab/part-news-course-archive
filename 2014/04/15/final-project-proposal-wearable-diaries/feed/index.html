					<description><![CDATA[A couple things I didn&#039;t get to say in class:
- I think this could be powerful tool for documenting newsworthy events with, as you call it, B-roll footage. Check out Joanna Kao&#039;s final project from last year. She faced some similar issues trying to look at how Vine could be used as a reporting tool. Short clips are great for giving context &amp; flavor of an event. 
- I think I mentioned this art project which put head cameras on 7 different people and projected a &quot;day in the life&quot; for each of them: http://www.symphonyofacity.org/. This was a pretty powerful context for seeing what would otherwise be &quot;boring&quot; everyday life video
- This might be especially powerful for people who are in extreme situations whose perspective we do NOT usually have access to. For example, there was a participatory photography project that gave cameras to migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.]]></description>
