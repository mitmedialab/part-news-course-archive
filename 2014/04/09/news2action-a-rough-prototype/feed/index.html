					<description><![CDATA[Interesting concept! I like being able to think about different actions and the amount of time they would take. This gives a real sense of the variety of approaches, while grounding me in the reality of how much effort is required of each. The one UX/UI feature I would add to this prototype is a rotating gallery, so that the slider slowly progresses through the options, helping me see that there are multiple options and possibly landing on a more involved one by the time I get down the page, which could inspire me to take one of the less involved actions at the very least.]]></description>
