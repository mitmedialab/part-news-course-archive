					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I’m not attending the class but was interested in so I follow a bit what you’re doing on this blog…
Regarding your ideas, do you know http://journalistsresource.org/ and http://theconversation.com?
The first one aims at hand-picking research findings and making summaries of them in order to enrich journalists’ sources. The second one gives the possibility to academics to write articles, in collaboration with the editorial team of the site, and gives their contact info if some media want to contact them.
I&#039;m currently studying the opportunity to launch The Conversation in France (I&#039;m French, I&#039;m currently in Boston but will be back to France in December 2014).
I would be happy to talk to you if you want to.
Best,
Gabrielle]]></description>
