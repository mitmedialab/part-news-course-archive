<p>For me, this exercise was a wake-up call. I’ve always thought that I was a moderate consumer of media, and that is why realizing that I spent around 8 hours per day consuming media this week was a revelation. <br> The diagram below shows my consumption per media outlet. I spent a significant portion of my time (3 hours per day) using Microsoft Outlook, which is the application I use for work. This diagram made me realize the amount of time I spend sending and receiving emails. I also noted the number of times (12 times per day) I used the Outlook app on my phone to check if I have received any new email. Social Media is another outlet that takes a significant portion of my time. This observation can be attributed to the fact that most of my family and friends live abroad, so social media offers me the best method to connect with them and know their news. <br> The other observation I noted was that I only spent 10 minutes per day on articles that I’ve opened through Facebook and Twitter. I honestly excepted this number to be higher. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9915" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-1-1.jpg 620w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-1-1-300x169.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-1-1-500x282.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><figcaption>Consumption per media outlet per day</figcaption></figure>



<p>I was also surprised to realize that 51% of my media consumption was done through my laptop. I think it might be because during my work day I sometimes take some mental breaks by reading some news and entertainment articles. I also sometimes use my laptop for viewing videos which might have attributed to my consumption pattern. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-2-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9916" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-2-1.jpg 620w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-2-1-300x143.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Media-2-1-500x238.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></figure>



<p>Another revelation for me was the significant number of mediums I consumed that are being tracked third-party data-tracking applications. By using “Ghostery” a web extension which allowed me to monitor and block these applications, I realized that third parties are tracking 45% of the media I consume.<br>  I have created the sculpture below to express my feelings regarding being continuously tracked by third party providers and by the media outlets I consume online. In the middle, there is the eye of the user being monitored by different digital eyes (representing the tracking of information) that are surrounding the user from everywhere, designed to make the user feel that the experience is as natural as possible so that the trackers can continue to mine data. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-20-1024x658.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9917" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-20-1024x658.jpeg 1024w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-20-300x193.jpeg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-20-768x493.jpeg 768w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-20-467x300.jpeg 467w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Overall, this exercise was eye-opening for me, and it allowed me to notice specific patterns in my consumption that I did not expect. It also prompted me to reconsider the way I consume media. </p>

<p>As Visiting Assistant Professor at the Media Lab / Social Machines, Dimitra studies the diffusion of “fake scientific news” in social networks. Drawing links between pseudoscience, populism and health literacy, she focuses on the anti-vaccination movement to provide a key venue wherein mis- and dis-information can be studied.</p>



<p>Dimitra is an Assistant Professor of Journalism at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece and has over 10 years of teaching experience. Her current research interests lie at the intersection of social media, journalism, and society.Alongside her academic appointments, she has worked as consultant in PR and communications. </p>



<p>She has been recently granted a Marie Curie Global Fellowship from the European Commission which is awarded to the most promising researchers from the European Union. Under this fellowship, she will pursue her research for two years at MIT and for one year at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. With her current project, Dimitra aspires to enhance the efficiency of science communication professionals and science journalists and provide insights that will empower public health policy makers to introduce fake-proof health literacy initiatives.</p>



<p>She is a self-taught avid knitter and a mum of two &#8211; 4 year old Eva and 9 month old Aris.</p>

<p>Overall this felt like a week of frustrated habits as I adjusted to term; in each of the four discovery mechanisms for textual media I use (social media, directly visiting websites like some kind of primate, email, RSS), I kept opening something automatically before realizing that I had urgent homework, research, organizing, partying, or fevering to attend to. Starting, however, from the means of discovery:</p>

This was a fun exercise, and I found a bunch of different ways to gather data on my media consumption. My iPhone&#8217;s weekly report showed me how many alerts I get per day (65!!), Google tracked my YouTube TV watching (daily Jeopardy habit). But most of all I realize that very few minutes go by in a day without me consuming some type of media: podcasts, music, books, etc&#8230; I&#8217;m constantly plugged in.</p>

remarkable influence on various aspects of our lives, and this influence is
only expected to rise. AI has already disrupted the field of journalism with
the introduction of &#8220;Algorithmic journalism&#8221; (Dorr,2015). Algorithmic
journalism involves a &#8220;software that automatically produces texts in
natural language from structured data.&#8221; Various economic reasons are
driving the rise of AI within journalism. First, AI spares journalists the time
to draft articles and news pieces that are relatively uniform such as daily
news reports about the performance of the stock market. AI&#8217;s use in editorial
tech helps writers and journalists review their pieces promptly. There&#8217;s also
an argument that AI may help reduce the biases in certain stories, but given
that the algorithms drafting the content may itself include the biases of the
person who coded them, this argument still has its flaws.

<!-- [if gte mso 10]&gt;-->

In its bid to enhance its ability to reap the fruits of AI in journalism,
Reuters has introduced an AI tool called Lynx Insight (Kobie, 2018). This tool
aims to augment journalists and writers rather than replace them by providing
them with analytical tools that synthesize big data in a way that nurtures
their journalistic role. Lynx Insight will analyze a vast amount of data to
identify any interesting patterns or topics that can allow Reuters the
opportunity to publish content that is innovative and pioneering, and at the
same time fits with the readers&#8217; interests. Lynx Insight aggregates the data
and sends the journalist a message with a brief about any interesting patterns
with some background about the story or topic. The App associated with the tool
provides journalists with a live feed of updates regarding any possible
breaking news stories.

AI’s growing influence in the field of journalism may have significant
implications on the future of news and media. AI may help journalists
personalize the news according to the interests of their audience, which may
enhance the appeal of the news and its readability. Its ability to reduce the
cost may allow new news and media outlets to enter the field which supports the
democratization of the field and may provide a competition that can support the
quality of the content. Unfortunately, this competition may also lead to the
deterioration of the content with news outlets fixated on competition and
monetizing content rather than nurturing the field and improving its appeal.
Over-dependence on AI tools such as Lynx Insight may reduce the journalist’s
sense of agency and innovation ability. This dependence may be destructive to
the field of journalism if there are issues with the algorithm, or if the data
used by AI has significant flaws.

<p>I work at the Harvard Graduate School of Education as an Associate Director for Professional Education and as a Teaching Fellow. I am responsible for managing and developing professional education programs and strategies for K-12 teachers, with a special focus on international audience. I also lead the <a href="https://partnews.mit.edu/2019/02/page/2/Middle%20East%20Professional%20Learning%20Initiative">Middle East Professional Learning Initiative</a>, which is an initiative that aims to support teacher educators and system-level leaders in developing practices, programs, and structures to help improve student opportunities to learn and achieve productive sustainable lives. </p>



<p> My research focuses on civic education, using&nbsp;informal learning to support education in low-income communities and&nbsp;teacher professional development. I earned my Master&#8217;s degree in Education in 2017 at HGSE.</p>



<p> I am from Egypt and I actively participated in the Arab Spring which was the highlight of my experience with the impact of participatory media in politics. The Arab Spring also influenced my decision to co-found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Mashroo3.Kheir/">Mashroo3 Kheir (The Good Deed Project)</a> NGO that focuses on promoting civic education among youth in Egypt.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m really excited to join the course and learn from everyone&#8217;s diverse experiences. </p>

<p><a href="https://shorthand.com/">Shorthand</a> is a platform that enables simple yet stunning visual storytelling for journalists, artists, statisticians, and any storyteller looking to explore dynamic digital means of telling their tales. In a time when empathy and compassion often feel scarce, storytelling with tools like Shorthand re-engage the emotion of an often jaded audience through paced, intentional, and visually dynamic storytelling. </p>



<p>Over the course of my time in academia, I have become quite in touch with how little I know. Everyday, actually, the pool of knowledge, the bank of content of which I am aware I need to learn gets bigger and bigger. So, naturally, I try to absorb as much knowledge as I can just to combat the growth of that pool of uncertainty, but the rate of understanding is always slower than the rate It feels like a sprint, one where I can see the end, but the faster I go, the farther away the end gets. It is an absolute race to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible.<br></p>



<p>In that spirit of panic learning, I have become an avid speed-reader. I remember having a deep pride in my ability to speed read, to skim, to find the gold nuggets of information in a sea of text at school. The structure of the piece? I know it like the back of my hand and could find the heart of it blindfolded. Anecdotes? Fables? Stories? Merely obstacles on my mission to dig up the seed of ground-truth planted and hidden deep within the essays of the old men of antiquity.<br></p>



<p>But with so much practice in my race for information consumption, out of repetition, habit, and training, I have a really hard time <em>not</em> speed reading. <br></p>



<p>My group, the Lab for Social Machines, is working on a project called the Local Voices Network. It is constituted of a “unique physical-digital network designed to bring under-heard community voices, perspectives and stories to the center of a healthier public dialogue.” In short, we have a lot of audio of people telling stories from their lives. As a part of my research, I’ve been reading the transcripts of these people’s stories. Some are deeply personal, raw, and emotional. Yet, while reading, I’ve found myself flying through them, zooming through the details, feeling little empathy or any emotion at all, only looking at it through an academic lens racing to find the key nuggets of information. And what a disrespect and disservice to those storytellers.<br></p>



<p>I’ve found now, that when I listen to the audio of those stories, slow down, hear them word for word, hear the emotion in their voice, do I feel some emotional tug. <br></p>



<p>I believe that is a key problem with media consumption in American democracy today: often, we feel little empathy, no compassion, and no emotion when we read or see stories that should be truly moving. <br></p>



<p>Of course, how the story is told plays a primary role in the consumer’s interpretation and the emotion they feel. However, I believe the medium is also key. <br></p>



<p>In order to feel more empathy and compassion when taking in stories, I’ve tried to give more attention to the emotionally stirring mediums. I’ve found them to be longform, often audio or video based, more based in detail, characters and humans, images, key moments, and so on. In these formats, we humanize the people in the story, feel their pain, visualize their circumstances, feel the emotion in the voice of the speaker, and empathize.<br></p>



<p>In my experience, I have found it to be more rare for text based stories to offer that same punch, both due to my incessant speed reading and the sometimes one-dimensional nature of the text I read (often news, often academic, and often cold). <br></p>



<p>Getting to the Point&#8230;</p>



<p>Shorthand enables text based stories to &nbsp;paces the reader and allows for easy, efficient, but stunning and deeply impactful visual storytelling. The<strong> </strong>visual storytelling<strong> </strong>of Shorthand allows artists, data visualizationists(?), storytellers, journalists, scientists, and whoever to collaborate on teams to tell a story that engages the reader. This collaboration enables illustration, photography, video, and data visualization to be enhanced by beautiful &nbsp;and informative language, and enriches traditional text-based stories, pushing them into a second or third dimension of communication.<br></p>



<p>The slow and intentional spacing of a story segmented not by paragraphs but by the consumer’s scroll rate allow for the writer to place emphasis on a single moment, a single image, a single line of text in a way reminiscent of &nbsp;to oral storytellers when they hit the climax, a moment of suspense, or a key moment of loss. <br></p>



<p>No longer can you zoom through a moment, zoom through a visualization, take only what you want to from the peice. Rather, the &nbsp;writer has a bit more control over what moments stick out in your mind as important, influential, and meaningful. <br></p>



<p>I’ve attached examples of stories that use <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/made_up_to_look_beautiful_sent_out_to_die">illustration</a> to promote empathy and emotion in stories whos punch can be diluted by news outlets, stories that break down data visualizations into more <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/news_women_in_congress">consumable packages</a>, moments where Shorthand has been used for <a href="https://www.redcross.ca/features/red-cross-pink-day/index.html">advocacy</a>, and a visual artist who has incorporated Shorthand into their art to create an array of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/portraits_of_the_mind">stunning self portraits</a>. <br></p>



<p>Finally, Shorthand is incredibly easy to use. I’ve linked one I’ve created about croissants <a href="https://shorthand.com/organisations/acUir5duQY/teams/LlVYLuWTD3/stories/32UuZlMzpE">here</a> that took me less than 10 minutes. They offer extensive tips on general storytelling and how to use their tool on their page, <em>The Craft</em>, that is useful for those who use the platform as well as for those who choose not to. The platform is not free (but offers a free 30 day trial if you want to check it out).<br></p>



<p>Overall, I would highly recommend this tool and other tools and media like it to re-engage emotionally distant or jaded audiences to reinvigorate and bring passion, emotion, compassion, empathy etc. back to what can sometimes feel like a dying or apathetic democracy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Searching twitter for only those tweets made in a particular time, in a particular location, is clearly a valuable tool. Twitter is a dazzling fountain of sources, and being able to tie those to a place and time provides context and reduces noise; it&#8217;s more likely that a journalist will be able to use the tweets they see in building a story</p>



<p>Geosearch has been around for a while; <a href="https://app.echosec.net/">Echosec</a>, present in a 2016 list of tools for journalists, is branded as a private security / &#8220;Open Source INTelligence&#8221; platform. With blog posts like &#8220;Social Media for Executive Protection&#8221; from 2015 and &#8220;How Executive Protection Services are Changing&#8221; from 2018, they&#8217;ve clearly found their niche, and since the time list of tools was written have stopped offering their tools to non-customers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9819" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image.png 517w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-300x250.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-361x300.png 361w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /><figcaption>Socialbearing&#8217;s map interface, selecting a tweet considered to have a strongly negative sentiment (it doesn&#8217;t).</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://socialbearing.com/">Socialbearing</a>, on the other hand, focuses on marketing feedback; &#8220;insights and analytics&#8221;, &#8220;sentiment analysis&#8221;, and &#8220;View top influencers&#8221; are their key features. Google Analytics is a clear visual influence (see image). Their product, thankfully, is still available, and even makes some noise about <a href="https://socialbearing.com/faqs/geotagged-tweets-and-privacy">randomizing location markers to protect privacy</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tweets_by_type.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9812" width="495" height="320" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tweets_by_type.png 716w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tweets_by_type-300x194.png 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tweets_by_type-463x300.png 463w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /><figcaption>Socialbearing&#8217;s interface. It&#8217;s always good to see that tweets, by Type, are 100% Tweets.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Journalists can obviously benefit from such tools in myriad ways, most obviously when covering chaotic live events such as a protest, riot, natural disaster, police scene, etc.. Historical searches provide a way to compare locations at a particular time, or track a location over time, providing the oppourtunity for spatially-rich narratives of an event.</p>



<p>But what are the implications of these tools? The breadth of interest in them, combined with the impression that they&#8217;re somehow more &#8220;real&#8221; than twitter (anything on a map is easy to imagine as having already truly happened), makes them an interesting vector for malinformation. Building a fake twitter account that could plausibly be in a particular location takes a different kind of work than your standard fake account, but it probably doesn&#8217;t need as many followers/follows to be noticed, and so may be more resilient to discovery attempts. Journalists using these tools may wish to practice a kind of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/reader-center/social-media-video-how-to-verify.html">&#8220;shadow analysis&#8221;</a> to verify whether the incidental information of these tweets and accounts is sufficient to verify a <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/support/troubleshooting/spoof-location-google-chrome/">highly spoofable GPS entry</a>.</p>



<p>What I find most intriguing, however, is the perspective these tools offer to the user. By helicoptering the journalist over mapped landscapes and letting them look down to spot individual tweets, they make the user feel powerful, godlike. The world seems understandable, and certainly the streets are understandable in a way they wouldn&#8217;t be from the ground during a protest, riot, or natural disaster. While the journalist is already in a position of being at their computer  and not on the ground, I feel like geosearches heighten that feeling of distance even more than looking at a stream of text does, and that concerns me. <strong>This flyover perspective seems like something that could easily creep into the tone of how something is covered, giving it a strong spin even in the absence of malinformation.</strong></p>



<p>EDIT: this only occurred to me just now in class, but while I saw several posts on &#8220;drone journalism&#8221; which meant by it using drones for photography, this kind of investigation by signature strike truly seems like journalism coming from the tradition of the drone, with many of the same strengths, the same weaknesses, the same fraught tradeoffs.</p>

<p>I am a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT. Prior to coming to Cambridge I worked as a correspondent for The Associated Press, based in Florida and San Francisco. I am a member of AP’s Global Environment team, a group of journalists who work in different places around the country and globe who cover issues related to climate, industrial pollution, wildlife management, etc… </p>



<p>My focus has been on stories that look at the intersection of the environment and public health. Most recently this was a series and data project looking at the t<a href="https://apnews.com/ToxicSites">hreat climate change poses to people who live around toxic waste sites</a> and other polluted dumping grounds. </p>



<p><a href="https://apnews.com/9d5904f83f6a4cf784828107fa7d038d">Narrative writing</a> is my passion. I’m now working on a book for a Penguin imprint, Avery, that tells the story of a disease outbreak, and the unregulated drug manufacturing industry that caused it. I grew up in California. </p>



<p>When I’m not working I enjoy surfing/swimming, playing the guitar, drinking beer with friends and cooking. <br></p>

<p>Hello! I&#8217;m currently in my 5th year as a Mechanical Engineering PhD student at MIT. I used to work in industry on small electric airplanes and (flying) wind turbines, but after seeing how fragile and vital the communications of our design concepts were, went to school to research these difficult to verbalize shared ideas.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve made a <a href="http://gpkit.rtfd.org">programming language</a> and <a href="https://convex.mit.edu">several tools for aerospace engineers</a> which have been adopted by industry, but this kind of shared creative concept doesn&#8217;t only occur in engineering, so I&#8217;m looking to co-design with other groups of skilled practitioners representations and tools that build on their tacit knowledges.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m very excited to work with y&#8217;all in this class; there seems to be such a breadth and depth of experience with news / media / journalism, and I look forward to collaborating on projects and assignments!</p>



<p>Outside of research you&#8217;ll find me cooking, trying to get engineers + students to consider the social implications of their research, making <a href="https://web.mit.edu/eburn/www/pent5.gif">mesmerizing gifs</a>, or casually interviewing strangers about the habitus of their workplace.</p>
