					<description><![CDATA[Great provocation, given that Reddit bills itself as the front page of the internet. I&#039;m sad that we missed an opportunity to factcheck cats and penguins. It&#039;s very interesting that a Reddit moderator stepped in on the North Korea case, as it wasn&#039;t factually incorrect but was, on the whole, misleading. That&#039;s a very &#039;human editor&#039; role to play.
I&#039;d like to see a little more factchecking on the Costco vs. WalMart debate. Republican policies (at the national level) are more hostile to fair wages than you let on here, but at the same time, Costco has clearly played this difference for good PR over the years.
5. OK Cupid&#039;s blog, OKTrends, used to have an entire post on the data behind religion and intelligence, but I can&#039;t find it. This graph remains though: http://imgur.com/FluMM
9. It&#039;s interesting the degree to which original reporting is necessary for online conversations, as you note by the links to the Miami Herald article. I say this as an online conversations guy, not a journalist.
10. All we need to do is infiltrate the sound studio where they&#039;re filming this whole charade. 
12. How heavy-handed are moderators in the drugs forum? This sounds like a useful post was deleted.

15. (and 2.) You do a nice job distinguishing between correct facts and misleading intents. The former is much easier for factcheckers to take on; they tend to draw criticism when they start playing referee of the latter. But the latter is important, to help us understand which speakers in the public sphere are speaking credibly and in good faith. I&#039;m not sure what we do with that.
