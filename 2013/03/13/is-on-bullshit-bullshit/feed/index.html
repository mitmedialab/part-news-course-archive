					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant self-assignment, Luisa! Very clever use of the class texts. A few random thoughts:
-check out the Noun Project for CC (and scaleable) icons 
-a game that serves up individual sentences from rhetoric-laden texts (maybe political speeches?) could be a fun way to train people to see these tactics out of context 
-Google &#039;Dan Schultz Truth Goggles&#039; and read the Neiman Lab post. It&#039;s a project similar to hypothesis that had a similar goal of engaging critical thinking rather than telling you the answer. 

Really nice work!]]></description>
