					<description><![CDATA[I applaud you for taking on one of the &#039;third rail&#039; topics in your factchecking quest, and look forward to the rest. Wikipedia is an interesting source for many reasons, one of which is that it&#039;s crowd sourced nature and attempted neutrality make it more interesting to critique than a clearly partisan source. 

One thing I&#039;ve thought about is which players in a contentious, decades-long debate might actually benefit from politicizing conversation to the point that non-extremists stay as far away as possible. 

At some point, maybe after you&#039;ve both finished your theses, you should chat with Shahar Ronen about his comparative Wikipedia study.]]></description>
