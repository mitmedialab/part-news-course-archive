					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting to take on a PSA with the fact-checking assignment. On the one hand, I think the poster only suggests those claims in its viewers&#039; minds if they are in the proper context -- it doesn&#039;t actually state these claims. But it does, in context, refer to a world where all three of these claims are accurate. This is the power of propaganda, which you do a nice job dissecting: it can suggest and imply powerful things without actually stating them. Your post made me think a lot about the context within which claims are made, and the effect that has on their accuracy.]]></description>
