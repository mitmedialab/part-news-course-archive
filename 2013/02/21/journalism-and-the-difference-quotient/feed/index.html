					<description><![CDATA[I agree with you and Erhardt - super interesting topic. I&#039;m meeting with a guy trying to build one of these systems on Sunday at 2pm if you want to join the convo.

Catherine, I also like how you introduce the (very fair) critique of the piece&#039;s focus on journalism as solving the information deficiency problem, when often it appeals to our emotions, for better or worse. Many news stories excite, motivate, scare, and depress, beyond simply creating the awareness Kovach and Rosenstiel describe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your coinage of the &quot;difference quotient&quot; to describe the breadth, diversity, and perhaps serendipity of our experiences and news consumption. I know there are news app developers who are thinking about this question of how to create algorithms of serendipity to marry the experience of pull news reading on a smart phone with the out-of-your-control joy of the newspaper&#039;s story bundle. I&#039;m really interested in thinking about interventions similar to the bus that create new public spaces and keep us brushing elbows with difference. Can we do this through digital ritual? Can we make it easy? Curious to hear your ideas.]]></description>
