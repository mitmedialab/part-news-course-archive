					<description><![CDATA[Hey Julia, 

It&#039;s neat that you got a chance to see this film! I like how you point out Zola&#039;s and Tiger Temple&#039;s loneliness and what the stakes for them in their reporting is. I actually had a chance to interview Steve, Zola and Tiger Temple about the film last spring. If you&#039;re interested in finding out more about them, you can refer to: http://www.onthemedia.org/blogs/on-the-media/2012/jun/05/high-tech-low-life/

See you in class!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is incredibly well written. Thanks Julia. The struggle of very human characters vs. an all-encompassing state reminds me of scifi like 1984. I&#039;ve been reading about soil pollution in China this week (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9890119/Chinas-countrymen-struggling-with-a-sick-Mother-Earth.html) and this documentary seems like it&#039;s a really nice intersection of these issues with the role of participatory media.]]></description>
