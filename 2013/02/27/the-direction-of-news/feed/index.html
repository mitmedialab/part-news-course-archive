					<description><![CDATA[This is a great point. Have you seen the &quot;Snow Fall&quot; piece that the NY Times did recently? It&#039;s packed with interesting visuals. http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek
It&#039;s funny how even radio, the most &quot;non-visual&quot; media of them all, is starting to incorporate visuals into stories every chance they get. Radiolab, for example, frequently refers listeners to their blog where they feature a ton of interesting images. They also actively promote listener contributions of designs, photographs, etc. I agree as well that being a critical consumer of images and graphics is becoming increasingly important and should be taught in schools (and also to adults! )]]></description>
