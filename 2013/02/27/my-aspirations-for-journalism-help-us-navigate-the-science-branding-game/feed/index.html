					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! Looks like we are all worried about how our coffee consumption affects our lives. :) StudyGrader is great idea for a project--I am going to look more closely at this. I would also like to brainstorm ways to better connect scientists and journalists, since I think the current relationships tend to be mutually exploitative in a way that is not necessarily beneficial to increasing public knowledge. Would love to discuss further!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great lede example. And you strike a balance of the factors that subvert supposedly objective science. Journalists themselves have similar pressures, between profit and peer credibility. I&#039;m interested in many of the challenges you mention here, including providing relevant contextual information and critiquing shoddy coverage of science (see my final project last year: http://www.studygrader.com/). I&#039;m excited to see where you go with this.]]></description>
