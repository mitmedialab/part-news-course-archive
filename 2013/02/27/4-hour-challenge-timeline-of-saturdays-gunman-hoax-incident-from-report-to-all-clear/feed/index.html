					<description><![CDATA[I was actually at MIT on Saturday morning for a Ruby workshop and was sent home immediately. It was kinda scary. It might be fun to play around with an open source software or plugin that lets you create an interactive timeline. I&#039;ve seen a few of these in the NYTimes but haven&#039;t been able to find any easy-to-use open source plugins or software that lets you quickly create a timeline. Perhaps someone in the class knows of such a tool. Anyway, thanks for filling me in on the details of what happened!]]></description>
