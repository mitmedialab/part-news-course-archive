					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Luis Beck for your comments, and I think you&#039;re totally right: visuals can tell so much of a story. That&#039;s why, as a Radio journalist, I&#039;ve been thinking about new paths for Radio in the new media environment.

					<description><![CDATA[This piece has such an intimate feel. I love the images, especially that of the hand with ink stains. It feels more like a visual ethnography rather than a news report, which is something I really like about it. And it&#039;s neat how the visuals tell so much of the story that you didn&#039;t need a whole lot of dialog, just a few personal anecdotes were able to convey a great deal. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
