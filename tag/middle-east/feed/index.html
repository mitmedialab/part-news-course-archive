								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past eight years, the coffee mega-giant&#8217;s reputation has been smeared in the Middle East. Leftists activists across the region have claimed that the <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/8101574/The_Starbucks_conspiracy_theory_how_a_coffee_chain_was_libelled_by_antiZionists/">organisation is a &#8220;Zionist entity&#8221; which gives direct support to the Israeli government &#8211; and even to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF)</a>. Pro-palestinian groups have called for a boycott of the group and staged protests outside Starbucks franchises in Beirut, London and in the Palestinian Territories. Although the global firm has tried to refute the claim many times, its reputation remains tarnished as many potential clients, in the Middle East and abroad, refuse to go anywhere near the Seattle-bred giant.</p>
<p><strong>What and when: Pro-Zionist rhetoric and funding</strong></p>
<p>The conspiracy theory exploded in July,11, 2006 when a fake letter, allegedly written by Shultz, the CEO and founder of Starbucks, confirmed the company&#8217;s active support to the state of Israel. The satirical letter was originally written by Andrew Winkler, the editor of a anti-Zionist website called <em>ZioPedia</em>. According to <a href="https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/reportsfeatures/how_zionist_is_starbucks"><em>NOWLebanon</em></a>, the statement was read by over 100,000 users on the site alone. <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.42.48-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4001" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-04 at 11.42.48 AM" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.42.48-AM.png" width="1000" height="684" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.42.48-AM.png 1000w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.42.48-AM-300x205.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.42.48-AM-438x300.png 438w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Starbucks-boycotters claim that Shultz himself, a  businessman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz">&#8220;born to a Jewish family&#8221;</a>, has made anti-zionist remarks at Jewish congregations such as the Temple De Hirsh SInai in Seattle in the past. They also point out to the fact that he received &#8216;Israel&#8217;s 50th Anniversary Tribute Award&#8217; from the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah in 1998 for &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Schultz">playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the US and Israel</a>&#8220;, according to his Wikipedia page. Activists also argue that <a href="https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/reportsfeatures/how_zionist_is_starbucks" target="_blank">&#8220;Schultz made donations to the charity the Jewish National Fund, and that this used to be posted on [Starbucks&#8217;] website&#8221;</a>. As such, boycott campaigns claim that the organisation financially supports the State of Israel, and has deliberately deleted that information from its website, but with not other evidence.</p>

<p><strong>TRUE or FALSE? </strong></p>
<p><strong>The verdict is&#8230;. FALSE.</strong></p>
<p>With some thorough-fact checking, it appears that the Starbucks&#8217;s CEO might have pro-Israeli tendencies but this does not imply that his company financially supports Israel, or that he personally benefits from the company revenues. The company is indeed publicly traded and as such all of its financial statements are publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Potential counter-strategies</strong></p>
<p>Rather than publish statements which reiterate and refute the conspiracy theory, Starbucks should pursue a more pro-active strategy by emphasizing on its positive role in the Middle East. Indeed, the company has in the past tried to distance itself from the CEO&#8217;s actions by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-continues-to-fight-rumors-about-links-to-israel/">releasing the following statement</a> (which is for some reason currently unavailable on its website):</p>
<p><strong> </strong> <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-9.36.48-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4002" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-04 at 9.36.48 PM" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-9.36.48-PM.png" width="666" height="294" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-9.36.48-PM.png 666w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-9.36.48-PM-300x132.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-9.36.48-PM-500x220.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></a></p>
<p>The coffee giant has also released anti-libel statements regarding its activities in the Middle East in 2010, in which it repeats and refutes more than 3 times (!) the Zionist claim.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.45.15-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4003" alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-04 at 11.45.15 AM" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.45.15-AM.png" width="722" height="721" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.45.15-AM.png 722w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.45.15-AM-150x150.png 150w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-11.45.15-AM-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Effective PR strategy for the MENA region</strong></p>
<p>The company should reinforce the impartial and maybe positive role it plays in the MENA region by highlighting the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buff up its <a href="http://mena.starbucks.com/en">MENA page</a> by highlighting the revenue, employment, and growth it is creating in the Arab world. Starbucks needs to make the argument that its franchises generate growth for local markets, and do not completely go back to the conglomerate.</li>
<li>Capitalize on the fact that <a href="http://news.starbucks.com/views/facts-about-starbucks-in-the-middle-east">Starbucks has actually shut down all its operations in Israel/Palestine since 2003 and that all its Middle East branches are operated by a Kuwaiti-based group called Alshaya</a>. While the company publishes this on its website (&#8220;We are also committed to hiring locally, providing jobs to thousands of local citizens in the countries where we operate.&#8221;), it should do a better job at outlining its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy in the MENA region.</li>
<li>Finally, the company should be aware of the complexities and the context it operates in and distance itself from Shultz if the CEO persist in making politically incorrect -or sensitive- comments. The company should, and can, publicly release its financial statements to demonstrate its impartial nature and hold critics at bay.</li>
