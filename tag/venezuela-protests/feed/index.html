								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Political analysts Ali Jafri and Gustavo Perez speak about recent developments in their countries of origin, Pakistan and Venezuela respectively, and look at how mainstream media has covered these events so far.</p>
<p>The idea behind this initiative is to give context to news stories that may have been covered by international media, but in a way that has been shallow or sporadic at some instances. We asked two of our colleagues from <a href="http://fletcher.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy</a> to comment on recent developments in their regions of expertise and give us the backstory.</p>
<p>Ali Jafri, a specialist in international security matters in South Asia, speaks about the <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1086747/karachi-car-bomb-kills-13-policemen-ttp-claims-attack" target="_blank">worsening security situation in Karachi</a> and its relevance to Pakistan&#8217;s overall security.</p>
<p>Gustavo Perez, a student activist from Caracas, who has previously worked in anti-corruption organizations in Venezuela, gives an overview of the past week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/18/us-venezuela-protests-idUSBREA1H0WU20140218" target="_blank">protests against the incumbent government</a> and the rising crime and homicide rates in the country.</p>
<p>Watch the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mibndhzxFL4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Start time: 5:30 (brainstorming, developing interview questions).</p>
<p>Finish time: 9:11(video-editing over dinner).</p>
<p>Produced by: Alexandra Taylor and Elissar Harati.</p>
