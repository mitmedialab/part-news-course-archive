								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Entering reporting on an unfamiliar issue or conflict is hard — but engaging the audience in a story mid-telling is something that television writers have faced for years; could we borrow what they’ve learned to help get readers up to speed on news more easily?<span id="more-6710"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">You’ve seen it on your favorite television drama. You’ve heard it on Serial. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recap_sequence">the recap sequence</a>!</p>
<p>For this assignment, I created a &#8220;recap sequence&#8221; that could be viewed before reading an article about an on-going or developing story. In this case, I started with this piece, &#8220;<a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/25/houthi-aden.html">Saudis launch air campaign to defend Yemen government</a>,&#8221; published by Al Jazeera on March 25, 2015.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/123804341" width="584" height="329" frameborder="0" title="Yemen: An Explainer (March 25, 2015)" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of creating an explainer for just this one story, I opted to try and come up with a way that every story could have a &#8220;recap sequence&#8221; using just material from the news organization&#8217;s archive.</p>
<p>I compiled the contents starting from the original article — published by Al Jazeera on March 25, 2015.</p>
<p>First, I collected all the linked articles (from in text or &#8220;related&#8221; boxes in the side and bottom margins of the story), pulling linked article data 3 layers deep.</p>
<p>Then, I scraped the images, captions, headlines, and deks associated with each link, using import.io and manual cut and paste.</p>
<p>Next, I organized the headlines chronologically.</p>
<p><a href="https://db1a884edf7079f14baa9eab4a9d0ddfa70037f3-www.googledrive.com/host/0B-J6ZbBs1bz1OWItOGNPdXcyWW8/Cards%201.html">I created a series of &#8220;cards&#8221; in a Google Fusion Table</a> to look at the potential material.</p>
<p>I then pulled all the images, headlines, captions, and deks into an Adobe After Effects composition. Each unique piece of text is displayed for 2-3 seconds, in order, with the associated images whenever possible.</p>
<p>I manually excluded a few &#8216;related&#8217; feature or opinion pieces, but otherwise tried to see if a relatively &#8220;autopilot&#8221; approach would yield a passable explainer.</p>
<p>My video editing leaves something to be desired, but personally, I thought it was a quick little way to get some background that helped me understand what was happening in the story!</p>
<p>See what you think!</p>
