								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The issue</strong></p>
<p>The United Nations <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/04/fund-crunch-forces-un-cut-syria-food-aid-20144851120732617.html" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday it will have to cut down on food aid to Syrian families in need because of a lack and delay of funding from donor countries. It is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/syrians-are-still-suffering-please-dont-forget/2014/04/03/8c64ea34-b8fc-11e3-9a05-c739f29ccb08_story.html" target="_blank">estimated</a> that half of the Syrian population currently needs humanitarian aid for survival and that 6 million persons are internally displaced.</p>
<p>Last January 15, relief agencies organized a second <a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/international/08-Apr-2014/un-might-cut-syria-food-rations-for-lack-of-donor-funds" target="_blank">&#8220;Pledging Conference&#8221; </a>under the auspices of the UN to rally financial support for the worsening humanitarian crisis in Syria. The donor countries initially pledged US$ 2.3 billion at the conference which took place in Kuwait, however, UN officials claim that they have received only 1.1 billion so far.</p>
<p>As a result, the standard food basket for a family of five, which is composed of rice, bulgar wheat, sugar, salt and wheat flour, has now been cut by 20 percent in March, according to officials from the <a href="http://www.wfp.org/videos/displaced-families-receiving-food-inside-war-torn-syria">World Food Programme</a> (WFP).</p>
<p>UNHCR also claims that it has experienced delays in donor pledges to Syrian refugees residing in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey. The agency expressed concerns over worsening economic and security conditions in many refugee camps.</p>
<p><strong>Why should you care? Or more practically, how does this affect you?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aside from the obvious ethical reasons, many ordinary Syrian citizens might die of hunger &#8211; especially when war, conflict, and political violence traps innocent bystanders and strips them of their livelihoods. So, maybe we could all gain to help the hungry and the helpless &#8211; whether they are in our immediate circle or not &#8211;  and make the world a better place (a somewhat better place).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The more civilians suffer from conflict, the more likely they are to turn to violence as a survival strategy. It&#8217;s no secret that economic hardships, unemployment, and deprivation breeds violence and instability (and turns ordinary individuals into terrorists or extremists). The more innocent Syrians suffer, in and outside of Syria, the more likely the conflict will endure and radicalize the rest of the region. Accordingly, neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Turkey have already witnessed spillover effects from the civil war in Syria. The international community does not stand to benefit from an increasing volatile and turbulent Middle East, which may &#8211; or may not &#8211; develop hostile attitudes towards the US, Russia and the European Union.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The increasing economic pressures on Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries, <a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/international/08-Apr-2014/un-might-cut-syria-food-rations-for-lack-of-donor-funds" target="_blank">as illustrated by the head of UNHCR</a>, pushes refugees to flee to developed countries in search of better opportunities. Sweden, the U.K., Norway and other European countries have already received waves of resettlement requests from Syrian nationals. If these requests are accepted, it will add further economic pressure on European economies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you can do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Donate! So you make sure that the funds get directly distributed to the beneficiaries. You can either make a monthly or a single contribution to UNHCR or the WFP. Your contributions will provide a number of Syrian families with drinking water, vaccinations and tents.</li>
<li>Click <a style="font-style: normal" href="https://donate.unrefugees.org/site/c.euISJ4NSKsLaG/b.8852215/k.BDC3/Home/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp?gclid=COjj4sip0b0CFUNqOgodaEkAiw&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> to donate to <strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">UNCHR</strong> and <a style="font-style: normal" href="https://donate.unrefugees.org/site/c.euISJ4NSKsLaG/b.8852215/k.BDC3/Home/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp?gclid=COjj4sip0b0CFUNqOgodaEkAiw&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> to help the <strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">WFP.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>OR you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a letter to your country&#8217;s delegation at the UN to comply with their pledges. The main donor countries are: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the U.K., the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, France and Canada. Click <a style="font-style: normal" href="http://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=search-reporting_display&amp;CQ=cq150114164828PK7VJ9PbHG" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> to find out whether <em>your</em> country took part in the 2014 pledge for humanitarian assistance in Syria.</li>
</ul>
