<p>I was going through my Twitter feed when I noticed Ethan Zuckerman&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/EthanZ/status/187283166782963712">tweet</a> about this Associated Press article: <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iJgioV9PXoClPLHUTWQ1XDyYmRxg?docId=46252ccd49ad44a9846e2eea284b1c32">Mali Coup leader stays put, despite sanctions</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first coup d&#8217;etat in Mali since 1991, when then-lieutenant colonel Amadou Toumani Toure removed Moussa Traore from office in the “March Revolution.” Amadou Toumani Toure was elected president in 2002 and was scheduled to step down in the presidential elections April 29, 2012.</p>
<p>The origins of this “accidental coup” can be traced back to the rise of Tuareg rebels, who returned home to northern Mali heavily armed after fighting for Muammar el-Qaddafi in the Libyan civil war. Since Mali gained independence from France in 1960, the nomadic Tuareg people have fought for the creation of a new state three times: 1962-64, 1990-95 and 2006. The heavily armed Tuareg rebels have helped reignite the separatist movement earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the months leading up to the coup, Mali soldiers have been frustrated by their lack of weaponry to fight the Tuareg rebels, who have captured several towns in northern Mali. The coup was ignited March 21, 2012, when the Mali defense minister Sadio Gassama visited the Kati military camp to try to defuse a planned protest by the Malian Army. The soldiers booed and threw stones at Sadio Gassama’s car, forcing him to temporarily seek refuge from his own troops. Later that day, Mali soldiers took over the presidential palace and Office of Radio and Television of Mali in Bamako, capital of Mali.</p>
