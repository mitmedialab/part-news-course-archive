				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In seventh grade, distraught from my recent findings on MSNBC that lip gloss may cause cancer, I began my search for a new news source. I wasn&#8217;t looking for anything in particular&#8211;most of my life questions were fielded by <em>Seventeen </em>and <em>Teen Vogue</em>&#8211;but I was hoping for something that could convey huge amounts of information to someone with an impossibly short attention span.</p>
<p>Seventh grade was 2005 trickling into 2006. It wasn&#8217;t until 2007 when election coverage became serious and I finally found the only articles on the election that I could begin to understand&#8211;T<em>he New York Times</em> graphs and multimedia articles. In 2008, when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/business/media/25asktheeditors.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">this interview with Steve Duenes, Graphics Director of the NYTimes</a> came out, I first saw the future of news.</p>
<p>It was this email that Steve Duenes quoted in his interview that made this change so apparent to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>From: Nicholas Kristof Subject: the power of art</p>
<p>in september i traveled with bill gates to africa to look at his work fighting aids there. while setting the trip up, it emerged that his initial interest in giving pots of money to fight disease had arisen after he and melinda read a two-part series of articles i did on third world disease in January 1997. until then, their plan had been to give money mainly to get countries wired and full of computers.</p>
<p>bill and melinda recently reread those pieces, and said that it was the second piece in the series, about bad water and diarrhea killing millions of kids a year, that really got them thinking of public health. Great! I was really proud of this impact that my worldwide reporting and 3,500-word article had had. <strong>But then bill confessed that actually it wasn&#8217;t the article itself that had grabbed him so much &#8212; it was the graphic. It was just a two column, inside graphic, very simple, listing third world health problems and how many people they kill. but he remembered it after all those years and said that it was the single thing that got him redirected toward public health.</strong></p>
<p>No graphic in human history has saved so many lives in africa and asia.<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sending you a copy of the story and graphic by interoffice mail. whoever did the graphic should take a bow.</p>
<p>nick kristof</p></blockquote>
<p><em>The Elements of Journalism</em> ends with a discussion on the purpose of journalism as a whole&#8211;something to be defined by its new constituents who are redefining news gathering and sharing. I don&#8217;t disagree with this conclusion. I also see the level of involvement of bloggers, tweeters and social media activists only growing in the upcoming decades, but I think the way in which we encapsulate our information is already rapidly changing. Visual communication skills should slowly be integrated into the current curriculum. Our 3,500 word articles will become a combination of a short video or handful of pictures taken with our phones, supplemented by clean visual representations that hopefully every grade school student can create just as easily as the heralded 5 paragraph essay.</p>
<p>Journalism is becoming more loosely defined with the rise of new outlets to share stories (and what is a &#8220;story&#8221;, exactly?), but I think the key will be in the <em>ways</em> in which we communicate. I don&#8217;t see news turning into a pure feed of microblogs and mobile uploads. I think it has a lot more to do with the tools and skills we are given that enable us to communicate more effectively with visual representations of our stories.</p>

			<p>“What do you want news to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>When we were asked this question two weeks ago, I had many vehement opinions about the future of news. I had been thinking about almost nothing else since hired at the Globe. Like many millennials, I was accustomed to the free access of information. When I began my job, and the reality of the journalism crisis suddenly woke me from my naiveté, my mind dashed off daydreaming about that “ah-ha” moment when journalists exalted their newfound path into the digital age. But as I continue to learn more, it seems as though there may not be an “ah-ha” moment, and that the entire enterprise of news is poised to crumble. And unlike other industries, there is yet to be a comparable, financially viable replacement to this establishment.</p>
<p>As I ruminated on and researched the possibilities for journalism, it became clear that&#8211;regardless of the current state of news&#8211;journalism is a highly skilled and necessary craft essential to progress as a modern society. Without it, we would be lost in something similar to the Dark Ages, subject to a sort of tyranny that naturally evolves from ignorance. In my mind, the question “What do you want news to do?” permutated into, “What are the pieces of modern news that must be preserved?”</p>
<p>First and foremost, the kernel of news is its ability to keep society informed and its leaders accountable. Regardless of where our new news comes from, it should continue to hold this value if we hope to preserve democracy.</p>
<p>New independent journalism seems to be moving back to a partisan viewpoint, which is refreshing and honest. I’m personally more trusting sources that admit their bias, than those that insist on their neutrality only to be engaging in clandestine partnerships. However, it’s important to remind the public that there are many opinions in the world, and we are each entitled to our own. The internet age has consequentially brought a din of information that individuals are left to sift through and make sense of. We have access to more kinds of media and knowledge than ever before, and it’s only natural to seek out the types of information we’re most interested in. But with partisan journalism, there needs to be a way to serve content from both sides of the playing field.</p>
<p>A journalist is a curator of cultural knowledge. News is like a museum of the present. A museum’s mission is to preserve the important aspects of art and culture through carefully curated sets of artifacts. News serves much the same role, but in real-time. Like curators, journalists train to dedicate their lives to the preservation of moments of reality in an insightful and engaging way. They encapsulate culture and share insight. Without curators, we are doomed to walk digital flea markets, hoping to stumble upon an important event that is crucial to our understanding of current affairs. But like most flea markets, all we’re likely to find is a collection of old recipe books from someone’s great aunt.</p>
<p>For journalism to continue someone must care about the preservation and curation of democracy. In a capitalist society, that someone also has to make a living from it. As is evident in software (specifically mobile) free is passable, but most paid services have a more polished product. The code is cleaner; the bugs are fewer. Obviously there are outliers on either end, but realistically this is the exception, not the rule. So as we move forward the question of “how?” remains unanswered. How does journalism remind us that we are lost without it, before we are actually lost and without?</p>

				<span class="sep">Posted on </span><a href="../../index.html%3Fp=2019.html" title="3:36 pm" rel="bookmark"><time class="entry-date" datetime="2013-02-27T15:36:39-05:00">February 27, 2013</time></a><span class="by-author"> <span class="sep"> by </span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="../../author/julia/index.html" title="View all posts by julia" rel="author">julia</a></span></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>“I used to be a no body…until I discovered the internet” a young glasses-clad man says as he stares at his computer screen. He proceeds to explain, turning toward the camera, how to circumvent China’s Great Firewall in order to access blocked websites like Twitter or Facebook.</p>
<p>This is Zola, one of the two citizen journalists followed in director Stephen Maing’s 2011 documentary feature <em>High Tech, Low Life</em>. The other, a 57-year old single retiree, is Tiger Temple.</p>
<p><em>High Tech, Low Life </em>is advertised as a documentary that addresses the challenges of censorship in China, but the film is equally a tale of bravery, compassion, and drive of these two Chinese men aspiring for a country that values truth and transparency over the Party and self-censorship</p>
<p>But while their motivation to risk government tracking or arrest for a greater cause is shared, the two bloggers diverge with regards to their characters and approaches to reporting. Maing follows Zola and Tiger Temple in two parallel story lines, slicing discussions on censorship and propaganda with scenes of scolding mothers and pet cats. Indeed, getting to know these two men is one of the many treats of this insightful and informative 87-minute film.</p>
<p>Tiger Temple is a solitary man who, divorced and retired, has devoted his life to chronicling the plight of fellow citizens shafted by the Communist Party in China.  His resentment toward the government runs deep; he blames Mao’s cultural revolution for making him homeless at 13. But the resulting vagabond life he adopted, biking around the country and meeting the poor farmers that the revolution supposedly served, contributed to a belief that loving his country did not mean loving the government, and provided the requisite inspiration necessary to conduct his risky work.</p>
<p>“I’m in my 50’s. I wont live much longer. I should tell the truth,” Tiger Temple states matter-of-factly as he explains why he keeps visiting farmers whose land was destroyed by government-routed pollution. Stunning scenes of lush fields are juxtaposed with damaged housing and polluted water, evoking an additional element of shame on behalf of the dishonest state for the viewer as the documentary progresses.</p>
<p>The slightly disheveled and reserved man continues despite the fact that government trackers follow him on his journeys and bust into his apartment overnight.  While Tiger Temple understands the personal risks of his work, his commitment to serving fellow Chinese and exposing the lies and injustices of the government, ultimately trumps his fear.</p>
<p>Zola’s mission is similarly infused with threats from the Communist Party; he is blacklisted, barred from leaving the country, questioned at his apartment, and tracked on the Internet.  Perhaps it is his age, but despite these obstacles Zola maintains an air of lightness throughout the film that is notably absent in his co-star’s scenes, who seems gravely aware of the beast he is battling.</p>
<p>Zola’s enthusiasm for writing about and filming victims of government injustice—such as a teenage girl who was raped by a government official or residents of Beijing evicted during the Olympics—is surprising when contextualized. His parents, weathered rural farmers, lecture him that “country comes first, then the individual” at the dinner table. They explain to a son whom they are baffled to call their own, that helping the public may lead to personal benefits in the future. Zola promptly excuses himself from the table, hops on his bike and leaves the family farm.</p>
<p>This is because to this young man, countering to the Communist party and exposing its injustices is the ultimate service to his nation. He claims that, “the truth is I don&#8217;t really know what journalism is. I just record what I witness”. While Zola is clearly not so naïve, his simplification speaks to the fact that just recording and publicizing the truth is a provocative and significant act in a country where &#8216;social order&#8217; and &#8216;cooperation&#8217; are used as justifications to stifle dissent.</p>
<p>Thus Zola and Tiger Temple both, although in distinct ways, take the Communist Party narrative of helping the country by cooperating and flipping it on his head, suggesting that to actually help Chinese citizens, transparency is the answer.</p>
<p>But although the idea is increasingly popular in some circles, especially as internet usage spreads in China, such work makes for a lonely existence. The viewer is introduced to some of Zola and TIger Temple&#8217;s fans, either through blog comments or in person at a blogger convention, but such instances are obviously rare. While the older of the pair has accepted this fate, Zola seems to still be grappling with it: at one of the lowest points of the film, he wonders &#8220;if anyone else in this world feels as lonely as I do&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, it is evident that both men are steadfast in their convictions and hopeful for a major shift in the future. An informative, insightful, and aesthetically gorgeous documentary, <em>High Tech, Low Life</em> gives the viewer hope, through introducing two incredible bloggers, that humanity in China is pushing the world&#8217;s most populous nation toward change.</p>

<p>I have admired Cory Doctorow’s books for a few years now. He has an amazing ability to weave simple explanations of technical concepts into rallying-cry stories. Doctorow recently released a new book, <em>Homeland</em>, and is on tour with the book. I went to his talk in Cambridge today. He is every bit as good a speaker as he is a writer.</p>
