			<p>The new Media Lab building, E14, was opened in 2009. The beautiful building, designed by the famous architect Fumihiko Maki of Japan, celebrates transparency, creativity and collaboration. The new building has also been equipped with various sensors across all internal spaces.</p>
<p>These sensors allow for a unique point of view into the building. In this article I will focus on temperature readings and will look into the stories entailed in the edge cases: the hottest and coldest spaces in E14.</p>
<p>First, some general statistics. 180 spaces are tracked in E14, every open space, meeting room, personal office and even storage units are monitored. The average temperature is 21.8c, which correlates well with the average thermometer setting : 21.9c. The readings I used were measured at 7pm, April 7th. Looking at the historical data reveals that the temperatures are stable throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Warm and Empathetic &#8211; Opera of the Future</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150408_103831.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6852" alt="IMG_20150408_103831" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150408_103831-300x222.jpg" width="300" height="222" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150408_103831-300x222.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150408_103831-1024x757.jpg 1024w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150408_103831-405x300.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The highest temperature reading in E14, 24.8c, was from E14-433, The living room for the <em>Opera of the Future</em> group on the upper deck of the <em>Swatch lab</em>. a quick visit to the space reveals that it is indeed warmer than other spaces in the building although being an open space with a thermometer set to 22c. It is quite possible that heat from the entire swatch lab accumulates in this specific point.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons, the warmth is well suited for the Opera of the future group. It fits right within the creativity and empathy which guide the group in it’s work.<br />
<em>(waiting for a comment from Tod Machover)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cold and Mysterious &#8211; E14-396T</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150407_205414.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6835" alt="IMG_20150407_205414" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150407_205414-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150407_205414-300x225.jpg 300w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150407_205414-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150407_205414-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The lowest temperature reading in E14, 13c, was measured in E14-396T. A mysterious locked door and a room number sign is all the innocent spectator has access to. Although it’s conceivable that behind the door is a storage unit or an electrical breaker box I can’t help but wonder: In the mystical playground that is the media lab, maybe an off the grid experiment is hidden behind that door? one that requires a cool 13c temperature.</p>
<p><em>Update: According to the Media Lab facilities department this space belongs to MIT IS&amp;T and is dedicated to communications. Intriguingly, no one in the media lab has access to this space. </em><strong><em><br />

			<p>For this assignment I worked in a project that evolved and get included in a larger one. I&#8217;m currently participating with my hometown university (ITESO) trying to understand what the newspapers are publishing related to political candidates, with elections for mayors and local congress in 60 days the team in Mexico is collecting the news related to the campaign every day.</p>
<p>With the news as a data set I processed it in <a href="http://wordij.net/" target="_blank">Wordij</a> a tool to generate semantic networks from .txt files, the software also gets a count of words in a csv file, this files where processed in Excel and then visualized in Tableau, with all the data we could run queries to know how many times a candidate has been mentioned by each newspaper, and adding data every day we are getting a larger picture of whom the newspapers are talking about.</p>

<p>As part of another project that I&#8217;m involved with to monitor the political campaigns, we decided to include the data-viz tool as part of the site, all the info is in spanish but if any one wants to try the tool you could use the right side panel, adjusting dates, frequency of words or search for specific words, for example search for &#8220;PRI&#8221; or &#8220;PAN&#8221; or &#8220;MC&#8221; political parties or for &#8220;Villanueva&#8221;, &#8220;Alfaro&#8221; or &#8220;Petersen&#8221; last name of the candidates. <a href="http://ciudadpixel.mx/elecciones/analisis-de-medios/" target="_blank">The visualization is here.</a></p>

			<p>Crime is often associated regarded by how someone perceives the environment he or she lives in. There are often places in a city that are more dangerous than others. However, are these places somehow attributable to the infrastructure within the community?</p>
<p>One hypothesis is brightness in the surrounding environment. While not bidirectional, but in unsafe regions, dark areas are perceives as especially dangerous. To test this hypothesis, I use the Boston Police crime report data and map the list of crimes occurring during nighttime to streetlight deployment. While incident reports seem quite ubiquitous, the crime density still seems quite high and perceivable in regions that are less safe and with less light installations.</p>
<p>Further, divide the crime incident by type, we can observe a heavy tail in terms of crimes that are distant from the nearest lights, emphasizing the perceptive unsafe nature. For example, crime types such as vandalism, burglary, and forgery have clear heavy tail. It is interesting to see crimes like vigilante and violence also share this characteristic to certain degree. This quick study provides a unique perspective to how interventions that cause perceptive differences may be a potential way to thinking about solving current municipal issues.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>By Melissa Bailey and Audrey Cerdan.</p>
<p>Every year, thousands of New Haven parents try their luck in a lottery for schools of &#8220;choice.&#8221; Most walk away disappointed: In 2012, &#8220;9,333 local and suburban students applied for 2,677 open seats at 29 charter and magnet schools covering grades pre-K to 12,&#8221; according to Bailey. Students who live near the school, or already have a sibling in the school, get first dibs on open seats.</p>
<p>Bailey wrote about this in <a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/magnet_lottery_data_released/">a 2013 article</a>. The interviews were good, but the data was &#8230; not so easy for the reader to picture. So Bailey recruited top Parisian digital journalist Audrey Cerdan to try to visualize it better.</p>
<p>Our mission: Give disappointed parents a better sense of their odds in the lottery, to inform their future choices. For example: Maria really wants her daughter to go to Barnard school, which has a fancy vegetable garden and a good reputation. But she lives way across town. What are her chances of getting in?</p>
<p>We answer that question &#8212; and many more &#8212; in this exciting data visualization. Click &#8220;search&#8221; to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="http://c0ebl016.caspio.com/dp.asp?AppKey=4a5e3000170b103a75874671b400"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6811" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-07 at 3.17.42 PM" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-07-at-3.17.42-PM.png" width="273" height="91" /></a></p>
<p>We used Caspio because Bailey liked the interactive dropdown menus and got a free account at a recent Super Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference. BUT it was not so easy to use. And in the end we decided bar charts weren&#8217;t the best choice.</p>
<p>Our major hurdle was how to represent the concept of &#8220;zero.&#8221; As in, you have zero chance of getting into that school if you don&#8217;t live nearby. At the end of our struggle with Caspio, we thought of a better way to visualize the data. We think Infogr.am would be a much better way to really give a sense of a person&#8217;s odds. Here&#8217;s a sketch by Cerdan:</p>

			<p>RECENT UPDATE OF CHAOS IN FERGUSON:</p>
<p><b><i>Journalists sue St. Louis County police for alleged battery, false arrest</i></b></p>
<p><b>Politico | Hadas Gold | 3/31/15</b></p>
<p>Four journalists are filing a lawsuit against the St. Louis County police department for battery, false arrest and unreasonable search and seizure while they were covering the unrest in the city following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in August.</p>
<p>The suit is being brought by The Intercept&#8217;s Ryan Devereaux as well as German journalists Ansgar Graw, Frank Herrmann and Lukas Hermsmeier. The suit seeks unspecified punitive damages.</p>
<p>In one incident, the suit alleges Devereaux and Hermsmeier were shot at with rubber bullets while walking toward police with their hands in the air and identifying themselves as members of the media. Police then arrested the two, holding them for several hours before charging them with &#8220;refusal to disperse.&#8221;  Devereaux and Hermsmeier allege that their hands were injured as the result of plastic handcuffs they were made to wear for several hours.</p>
<p>Graw and Herrmann were arrested while trying to cover the protest and police activity at a gas station. According to the suit, Graw continued to take photographs after being told to &#8220;keep moving&#8221; by police while Herrmann questioned the directive. At that point, the police arrested the two journalists and allegedly purposely tightened the plastic handcuffs to inflict pain. When Graw asked for one of the arresting officer’s names, he replied “Donald Duck.” Both Graw and Herrmann allege that they suffered injuries from the handcuffs.</p>
<p>In both incidents, the journalists allege police complained about media coverage of the events in Ferguson. Graw and Herrmann were told they should be &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of being journalists.</p>
