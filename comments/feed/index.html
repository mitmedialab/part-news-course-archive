					<description><![CDATA[We came across that when doing our research. One might hope the online portal speeds things up by organizing requests in a better way for the FBI. I can&#039;t imagine it gets much worse because they are already pretty slow at responding and actually fulfilling requests.

MuckRock actually posted an article about what the changes mean a few days ago: https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/feb/07/fbi-foia-portal-bad/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m Anne Crosby, and I am a first year student in Harvard Divinity School’s master of theological studies (MTS) program. I am focusing on Chinese politics, ethics, and religion. 

I majored in History and East Asian Studies as an undergraduate and went on to earn a masters degree in information science. After teaching at the post-secondary level in California and earning an Ed.M., I decided to combine my interest in technology with my background in East Asian and pursue yet another masters degree. 

I’m certainly not a master programmer, but I have basic coding experience, UI, and web design skills. For me the internet is about culture and human interaction—technology is a means but not an end. This course is exciting because it will be an opportunity to collaborate with some amazing classmates. I have no experience in journalism, but I love putting my info. science background to work sifting through tidbits of information and connecting the dots.

I am a consummate traveler and take every opportunity to explore the world outside of the US, spending most of my time in South and East Asia; however, Antarctica is the most incredible place I have visited. Amazing. 

Things I think about sometimes:

•	&lt;i&gt;What’s&lt;/i&gt; the news that’s fit to print?
•	&lt;i&gt;Who&lt;/i&gt; the heck printed that anyway?
•	Also:
o	Soft power, propaganda, transnational trolling
o	Networks of trust
o	The role of local/localized news in civic engagement
o	Net neutrality and censorship
o	Internet sovereignty vs. a free and open internet]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe I read this week that the FBI will no longer accept FOIA requests by email but will require written or faxed requests. The article I read speculated that it was an attempt to slow down response time. They will also accept requests via an &quot;online portal.&quot; I wonder what the impact will be.

					<description><![CDATA[Ghost is an open source web publishing platform first launched in 2012 and funded as a Kickstarter campaign. Indivisible Somerville, a loosely organized advocacy group based on the Indivisible Guide, launched an “Indivisible Labs” blog on this using Ghost, which is how I found out about the platform. The company maintains its non-profit status and discloses its finances in an effort to maintain transparency. The lowest priced plan $19.00/month for 50,000 page views, which is more expensive than some other platforms. The company is attempting to identify revenue models that might assist content writers in funding their work and is also funding promising new publications via its journalism program. 

One frequent criticism of open source tools is that they “work” but many of them are not user friendly. Ghost avoids this pitfall. It would be nice to see this kind of intuitive usability in other tools such as PGP encryption products. Because the platform is open source, its code can altered (and scutinized) by users and programmers. It appears to be a stable, well-maintained publication system. In 2015, GitHub was targeted with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, presumably by a state actor, seeking to force GitHub to remove certain content related to censorship from its servers. Ghost, while not intended to subvert internet censorship efforts, does provide a flexible platform that users can customize. It will be interesting to see what they rollout over the next year or so.
