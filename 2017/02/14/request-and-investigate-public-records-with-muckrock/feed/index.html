					<description><![CDATA[We came across that when doing our research. One might hope the online portal speeds things up by organizing requests in a better way for the FBI. I can&#039;t imagine it gets much worse because they are already pretty slow at responding and actually fulfilling requests.

MuckRock actually posted an article about what the changes mean a few days ago: https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/feb/07/fbi-foia-portal-bad/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe I read this week that the FBI will no longer accept FOIA requests by email but will require written or faxed requests. The article I read speculated that it was an attempt to slow down response time. They will also accept requests via an &quot;online portal.&quot; I wonder what the impact will be.
