								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disclaimer: this a four-hand review. We collaborated on the interview and the writing. Every sentence was drafted and edited by the two authors simultaneously. The piece is trying to bring back a bit of the old fashioned impressionistic twist into the lists craze.</p>
<p>Timing: 30 min to decide topic, 60 min interview, 30 min sharing notes, 75 min writing and editing.</p>
<p><strong>10 tips on writing a book (this is not a list)</strong></p>
<p>by AJ and Ricardo</p>
<p><b>A Harvard Fellow writing a book on international affairs shares his thoughts on the creative process (warning: this article is ISIS, Cuba and elections free)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re sitting at your desk on yet another normal snowy day in Cambridge, MA. Tea is hot and ready. You even got that snack to sustain you through the afternoon. You flip your laptop open and you are about to act on you latest brilliant idea. You are going to write a book. You have just forgotten the most important tip about writing a book: it is a lonely affair.</p>
<p>Your life is about to turn into a one-person marathon, you and your shadow carrying that computer (and it better be an Apple) through the city’s quietest corners and emptiest parks.</p>
<p>This was the first warning we got from H.K, a middle aged lawyer and diplomat, half-Latino and half Middle Eastern, who’s been in Cambridge for two years and just emailed his manuscript to his publisher and friend of 10 years in Argentina.</p>
<p>Why did you write a book, we asked him over decaf coffee in a campus cafeteria bustling with rushed students and even more rushed Buddhist monks.</p>
<p>“You cannot grow without criticism. You have to let the public judge you.” So whatever the topic that keeps you up at night, world peace or the best apple pie recipes, your book is a discussion, a new debate about –often- old issues.</p>
<p>Discipline or inspiration? According to H.K, inspiration gets you started, disciple writes your book. “In my case, I read and research for a week, and I write for a week. 6 hour-days. Discipline is everything.” Writing is like jazz. To the untrained ear it sounds like a lot of improvisation. But you better stick to the rhythm.</p>
<p>As the interview was drifting, again, to snow logistics, H.K interrupts us: “My book is a very important part of my legacy.” In Latin America, a life with purpose can be summarized like this: “Tenga un hijo, siembre un árbol, escriba un libro”…. “ have a child, plant a tree, write a book”… those were our grand-fathers’ words on a life well lived. It is neither narcissism nor megalomania, just a guy writing and thinking about his grand-kids.</p>
<p>And remember, every couple of hours, you’ll stop writing, check your iPhone and go on Twitter. And that scary thought will hit you: with all those millions of ideas out there, am I actually adding something original, or just more clutter?</p>
<p>Warning: you are now on the highway to writer’s block. H.K gave us his tip to find the exit: if your book is personal, if it is about you, and if it stems right from something that makes you different, you’ll have nothing to worry about. H.K’s writing is all about his unique perspective as the son of Arab immigrants in Latin America, who studied in Germany, married an American woman and has an American son. If you let your personal journey speak through your academic credentials (H.K has a PhD in international law), somebody out there will find your book original.</p>
<p>You might find it lonely, this writing-a-book business, but it is still the most honest and thoughtful way to start a conversation with “everybody”.</p>
<p>Remember, we promised you tips but no lists&#8230;</p>
