<p>In this case, the previous information comes in the form of a video that reports on the recent water shortages in California, conveying the struggle amongst farmers and residents in the state.  Our research and display of information was designed to be as unbiased and as educative as possible.  To accomplish this, we decided to implement a poll (to engage the reader) and then to supply them with easily accessible information (in case they wanted to <em>do</em> <em>something</em> about what they just saw and read).  We strongly believe that the combination of the poll, followed by immediate action steps, will help alleviate readers&#8217; feelings of helplessness concerning a seemingly distant problem.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RECENT UPDATE OF CHAOS IN FERGUSON:</p>
<p><b><i>Journalists sue St. Louis County police for alleged battery, false arrest</i></b></p>
<p><b>Politico | Hadas Gold | 3/31/15</b></p>
<p>Four journalists are filing a lawsuit against the St. Louis County police department for battery, false arrest and unreasonable search and seizure while they were covering the unrest in the city following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in August.</p>
<p>The suit is being brought by The Intercept&#8217;s Ryan Devereaux as well as German journalists Ansgar Graw, Frank Herrmann and Lukas Hermsmeier. The suit seeks unspecified punitive damages.</p>
<p>In one incident, the suit alleges Devereaux and Hermsmeier were shot at with rubber bullets while walking toward police with their hands in the air and identifying themselves as members of the media. Police then arrested the two, holding them for several hours before charging them with &#8220;refusal to disperse.&#8221;  Devereaux and Hermsmeier allege that their hands were injured as the result of plastic handcuffs they were made to wear for several hours.</p>
<p>Graw and Herrmann were arrested while trying to cover the protest and police activity at a gas station. According to the suit, Graw continued to take photographs after being told to &#8220;keep moving&#8221; by police while Herrmann questioned the directive. At that point, the police arrested the two journalists and allegedly purposely tightened the plastic handcuffs to inflict pain. When Graw asked for one of the arresting officer’s names, he replied “Donald Duck.” Both Graw and Herrmann allege that they suffered injuries from the handcuffs.</p>
<p>In both incidents, the journalists allege police complained about media coverage of the events in Ferguson. Graw and Herrmann were told they should be &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of being journalists.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this assignment, I chose to focus on space exploration and the U.S.&#8217;s transition into the private sector for funding and operations.  Originally, I was pro-space exploration, pro-private-sector funding with government support.  However, one has to ask oneself if attributing such funds for space exploration is moral, when we have poverty and natural disasters affecting billions of people on our planet?  The facts I found were astonishing. Despite being &#8220;pro-space exploration&#8221; and having that undoubtedly shape my research, I wasn&#8217;t aware of NASA&#8217;s Spinoff program.  Spinoff bolsters scientific research and innovations (funded by space exploration money) generated by space exploration research, to help improve living conditions in societies around the world.  To see a more in-depth look into the research coming out of space exploration, visit: <a title="NASA's Spinoff Program" href="http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf">http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf</a></p>
<p>Its important to note that &#8220;people grossly overestimate the budget that NASA gets,&#8221; said Niebur. Obama&#8217;s fiscal year 2016 budget calls for <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/NASA_FY_2016_Budget_Estimates.pdf" target="_blank">$18.5 billion</a> overall for NASA — 0.46 percent of the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7962585/fiscal-year-2016-budget-usa" target="_blank">federal budget</a>. &#8220;Most people think it&#8217;s 10 times that much.&#8221;  Furthermore, according to the <a href="http://planetary.org/" target="_blank">Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit space research and advocacy organization, for the planetary science division to run well, the United States should spend at least $1.5 billion every year to explore other worlds which is less than what &#8220;Americans spent on dog toys in 2012.&#8221; (<em>Vox.com</em>, 2/23/15)</p>
<p>Congress is also set to review NASA&#8217;s 2016 budget request, which is set at $1.2 billion (<em>USA Today</em>, 03/10/15)</p>
<p>To convey my point, and the various facts I collected, I implemented Sketch 3 (<a title="Sketch 3" href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/</a>).  In hopes that this visual representation would have a more compelling and less aggressive impact on my viewers.  I hoped this layout, combined with these images, would provide more compelling evidence for those opposed to any funds being attributed to space exploration (from private of public sources).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve determined that despite the gross amount of funding that is required for space exploration, (especially when that money could be used directly to aid in developing nations and to end poverty and starvation) private sector funding of space exploration not only allows people to continue their grandiose dreams of space exploration, but it&#8217;s also responsible for scientific achievements and improvements that are implemented on a global scale (to improve the lives of billions). <i>Despite global poverty and natural disasters, space exploration funding and action have helped save lives here on Earth.  Continuous private sector funding will expand our presence in space while contributing positive scientific advances in other sectors of society… </i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I attended Professor Steven Pinker&#8217;s lecture &#8220;Three Reasons to Affirm Free Speech&#8221; at Wellesley College, hosted by The Freedom Project (http://www.classical-liberalism.org/).  The lecture, which occurred on February 18, 2015, started at 8:00PM and finished at 9:00PM.  To produce this story, I took notes during the lecture and decided to implement &#8220;Zeega&#8221; after.  Check out the results below:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HomePage-copy.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5324 alignleft" alt="HomePage copy" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HomePage-copy-169x300.jpg" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HomePage-copy-169x300.jpg 169w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HomePage-copy-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HomePage-copy.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a>I got inspiration for my media diary from an online magazine called <em>Flipboard</em>, (https://flipboard.com/) which is a social-networking aggregation magazine-format mobile app that can be customized to your exact media specifications.  I am obsessed with <em>FlipBoard</em>, as it compiles all of my media apps (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram&#8230;etc) and displays them in a dynamic and clean way.  I can even select news outlets that I love reading and have them constantly refreshed into my feed.</p>
<p>I put my photoshop skills to the test to further customize this design, to make it my own media app &#8220;diary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5325 alignright" alt="SocialMedia" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SocialMedia-169x300.jpg" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SocialMedia-169x300.jpg 169w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SocialMedia-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SocialMedia.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p>This first screen shot of the app (above) has a photo of me and a brief introduction to my media diary.</p>
<p>The second screen shot (right) is comprised of the top three webpages I visited over the past 168 hours, which are: G-mail, Facebook, and Twitter.  G-mail is always open on my iPhone and my computer, I&#8217;ve noticed how much I rely on this source for anything from communication to information.  I really try not to use Facebook that much, but I am in a new course this semester that requires we have an active Facebook account.  Lastly, I heavily rely on Twitter for most of my news information.  Through Twitter I can stay up-to-date on worldly news while I am in school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5326 alignleft" alt="Tech" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tech-169x300.jpg" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tech-169x300.jpg 169w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tech-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tech.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" />The third screen shot of my app diary (left) represents the technologies (or communication mediums) I used to implement/access my media.  It turns out I use my phone <em>way</em> too much.  From the first moment my iPhone alarm goes off in the morning, to the time I set my it at night, I am on my phone.  But, to my defense, my phone is the way I communicate, with friends, with family, with professors, and with potential employers.  My phone gives me access to instantaneous information from around the world, including news and entertainment media.</p>
<p>When I am not on my phone I am on my computer, taking notes for class, accessing school readings, editing my portfolio, connecting with professors/employers, and (when I get the chance) watching movies/listening to music.  When I am not slave to my devices, I am verbally engaging with my friends, family, or whomever I may be conversing with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5400 alignright" alt="Entertainment" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Entertainment1-169x300.jpg" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Entertainment1-169x300.jpg 169w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Entertainment1-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Entertainment1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p>The fourth screen shot (right) represents the top entertainment media sources I utilized this past week.  When I found a chance to unwind, I watched a movie on Amazon Prime or Netflix, read silly articles on BuzzFeed, worked on Photoshop, and perused FlipBoard. However, it is important to note that I also accessed entertainment media on my phone, such as SnapChat, Instagram, Spotify, and FlipBoard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5329 alignleft" alt="SharedWithMe" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SharedWithMe-169x300.jpg" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SharedWithMe-169x300.jpg 169w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SharedWithMe-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SharedWithMe.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p>I thought it was important to note the information that has been shared with me this past week, regarding media technologies.  This is why I decided to add a screen shot (Left) of media related outlets that have been shared with me by my classmates, such as: Storify Balsamiq, StatsMokey, ReportIt App, and Timeline JS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5328 alignright" style="color: #333333;font-style: normal;line-height: 24.375px;border-color: #bbbbbb;margin-top: 0.4em;background: #eeeeee" alt="News_Media copy" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/News_Media-copy-300x266.jpg" width="300" height="266" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/News_Media-copy-300x266.jpg 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/News_Media-copy-1024x908.jpg 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/News_Media-copy-338x300.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The results are in (Right), and the top news media outlets I used this past week (according to how often I visited them) are as follows:</p>
<p>Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Instagram, NBC News, Snapchat, Fox News, YouTube, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, and The National Review.</p>
<p>All of which I visited on my iPhone and laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5403 alignleft" alt="Conclusion" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Conclusion1-169x300.jpg" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Conclusion1-169x300.jpg 169w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Conclusion1-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Conclusion1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p>In conclusion (Left), I spent about 58.333% of my day, or 14 hours, involved with media tech communication.  The top media I used were Twitter (for news collection), G-mail (for communication and sharing), Microsoft Word (for homework/notes), and Facebook (for news/communication).  I accessed this media the most via my iPhone.</p>
