<p>I was 15 minutes late to my meeting to interview Borja Echevarría de la Gándara, deputy managing editor of <em>El Pais</em>, Spain’s largest daily newspaper. Lucky for me, I found a smiling Borja sitting on one of the Media Lab’s plush couches. After a brief round of hellos, we started chatting and our conversation almost immediately went to newspapers when I asked Borja, currently a <a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/NiemanFoundation/NiemanFellowships/MeetTheFellows/CurrentFellows.aspx">Neiman-Berkman Fellow in Journalism Innovation</a>, about his research on the structural evolution of newsrooms and the effects of disruptive innovation on news business models.</p>
<p>Like so many news reporters, Borja started his career working the night desk at <em>El Mundo</em> in 1995. But unlike so many within our industry, this Bilbao-born former law student turned journalist quickly switched his attention toward the then emerging field of online news. A promotion from breaking news to society coverage to editor led to mixed emotions regarding his place in the newsroom. “I didn’t like being an editor so young,” said Borja.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was his age or perhaps it was just where the industry was headed but at some point in his career, Borja became fascinated by integrating online and print media and eventually left his post as online managing editor at <em>El Mundo</em> to help establish <em>Soitu.es</em>, a critically acclaimed online news startup. Co-founded with reporters and engineers from the newspaper, the experience transformed Borja&#8217;s approach to news. “I don’t like to think about things just online and in print, it’s not so much about platform—it’s about content.”</p>
<p>It also turns out that markets and the economy matter, too. Offering a fresh perspective in a sea of traditional Spanish media, <em>Soitu.es</em> won awards from the Society for News Design and the Online News Association. But innovation and accolades didn&#8217;t keep the news site from falling to the realities of the financial crisis. Two months shy of its second anniversary, BBVA, the site’s main financial investor, backed out and the site folded.</p>
<p>Like any startup founder worth his weight in salt, Borja was already onto cultivating his next journalist iteration before the dust had settled at <em>Soitu.es</em>. In 2010 he joined Spain&#8217;s largest daily as deputy managing editor bringing with him lessons from his experiences in traditional and experimental newsrooms: “If you try to change things just from online, you have to change the entire newsroom.”</p>
<p>And change the newsroom he has. Coming back to a daily newspaper hasn’t altered Borja’s embrace of cross-platform journalism. Along with a set of fresh ideas, Borja also brought his IT team from <em>Soitu.es</em> to <em>El Pais</em>. “If there’s any chance of survival…I think we need to combine tech, content and business,” Borja said of the future of the industry.</p>
<p>Of course, change does not happen over night. One of his first moves as head of <em>El Pais</em> was to change the morning news meeting time an hour earlier from 11 a.m. to 9 a.m. Borja knows that peak online traffic occurs in the morning and an earlier start time might make sense but the editor was sure to caution that change doesn’t happen overnight. “If I started my meetings at 8 a.m. my head would get cut off,” he joked.</p>

<p>After monitoring my media consumption this past week, I came to a rather unsurprising conclusion: I spend a lot of time staring at Power Point presentations.</p>
<p>As a student, it&#8217;s no shocker that the largest portion of my media intake comes from lectures and presentations. This week included a lecture from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quI96ZfM13Ihttp://">John Sterman</a> at Sloan and a presentation on the remediation of a former refinery in Baltimore, Maryland. My frequent exposure to big-screen learning might also explain why I find myself looking for shorter, smaller bursts of media on my walks home. It turns out that those between-class glances at Instagram, Twitter and Facebook add up. Even more pronounced was my social media usage while in &#8220;transit.&#8221; I happened to go out of town this weekend and happened to spend an embarrassing amount of time using social media, text and email on the flight and going to-and-from the hotel and my research site. Overall, I chose to represent my data set in four categories: MIT, Home, Transit and Field Work. A few reflections on each category:</p>
<p><strong>MIT</strong><br />
I spend a lot of time here. This category marked the broadest range of uses with everything from online news to in-person presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Home</strong><br />
I tend to do a lot of in-person interacting at school so I tend to catch up on my reading at home.</p>
<p><strong>Transit</strong><br />
I typically bike to school but traveling with a studio team to Baltimore required a substantial amount of coordinating which we accomplished via text.</p>
<p><strong>Field Work</strong><br />
My camera ran out of storage during a site visit for another course. I wound up working around things by taking photos via Instagram.</p>
