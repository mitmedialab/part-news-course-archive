								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I put together a bunch of Vines shot by people who went to the Red Sox Opening Day on Monday. I found that there were things Vines were great for, and some Vines were really impossible for.</p>
<p>What Vine was great for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Songs! People like singing at baseball games, and it&#8217;s great to actually hear and see people singing.</li>
<li>The flyover: People like fast planes. You can even enjoy Vines on the flyover without the sound turned on.</li>
<li>Watching the actual game: Again, another Vine you can watch and enjoy even without the sound.</li>
</ul>
<p>What Vine was bad for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually learning about what happened in the game: I didn&#8217;t see a single Vine that had the score in the caption. I had no clue what the final score was (although I knew the Red Sox had won).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of how my Vineyard of Red Sox looked like (prototype running locally on my laptop — I&#8217;ll try to do a demo in class since screenshots of Vines is kind of sad&#8230;).</p>

<p>Everything seems to be internally consistent, which doesn&#8217;t necessarily imply that any or all of this is true. Further research and chemical testing for calcium is probably necessary&#8230; but that&#8217;s probably for a different day.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a Twitter addict — I have the Twitter app on my phone and both Twitter and Tweetdeck on my laptop. For the most part, that&#8217;s where I consume the most media. For a week, I tried to keep track of all the links I clicked on and read on Twitter via my laptop and tweet about them at @MediaMemoir. Below is a chart showing the links that I tweeted about at the account.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/2013/02/13/media-diet/mediadiet/" rel="attachment wp-att-1776"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1776" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mediadiet-1024x98.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="55" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mediadiet-1024x98.jpg 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mediadiet-300x28.jpg 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mediadiet-500x48.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>This graph doesn&#8217;t show the types of media that I encountered from TV, articles I read on my phone or in print, or all the tweets I read (if I kept track of every tweet I read&#8230; I don&#8217;t even want to go there). For the most part, I don&#8217;t tend to spend much time clicking links and reading on my phone. However, most of my light media consumption probably comes from reading quick summaries and tweets via Twitter (which is not on this chart).</p>
<p>Most of my heavy media consumption (actually reading an article or watching a video vs. just reading &lt;140 characters about it) happens in a few dense chunks during the day. These chunks are mostly determined by my schedule.</p>
