								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m Anne Crosby, and I am a first year student in Harvard Divinity School’s master of theological studies (MTS) program. I am focusing on Chinese politics, ethics, and religion.</p>
<p>I majored in History and East Asian Studies as an undergraduate and went on to earn a masters degree in information science. After teaching at the post-secondary level in California and earning an Ed.M., I decided to combine my interest in technology with my background in East Asian and pursue yet another masters degree.</p>
<p>I’m certainly not a master programmer, but I have basic coding experience, UI, and web design skills. For me the internet is about culture and human interaction—technology is a means but not an end. This course is exciting because it will be an opportunity to collaborate with some amazing classmates. I have no experience in journalism, but I love putting my info. science background to work sifting through tidbits of information and connecting the dots.</p>
<p>I am a consummate traveler and take every opportunity to explore the world outside of the US, spending most of my time in South and East Asia; however, Antarctica is the most incredible place I have visited. Amazing.</p>
<p>Things I think about sometimes:</p>
<p>• &lt;i&gt;What’s&lt;/i&gt; the news that’s fit to print?<br />
• &lt;i&gt;Who&lt;/i&gt; the heck printed that anyway?<br />
• Also:<br />
o Soft power, propaganda, transnational trolling<br />
o Networks of trust<br />
o The role of local/localized news in civic engagement<br />
o Net neutrality and censorship<br />
o Internet sovereignty vs. a free and open internet</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With only about three and a half hours left, I’m seated on the floor of the Museum of Fine Art scrawling words on page. I hadn’t planned to do my assignment so early. I didn’t even have anything planned originally. The MFA sports a price tag of “optional donation” on Wednesdays and my boyfriend’s only in town for a week, so off to the museum we went. What I didn’t expect to find here was my story.</p>
<p>The MFA currently has a performance art piece in session in the middle of the contemporary art section. Marilyn Arsem presents “100 Ways to Consider Time.” It’s a performance art piece in which the artist, Marilyn, sits in a stark white room for 6 hours a day for one hundred days straight. The MFA’s website explain performance art stating “Like time itself, performance art is ephemeral. All that remains following a performance is how it is subsequently recalled through memory and retellings.” So here is my retelling of experiencing “100 Ways to Consider Time.”</p>
<p>Marilyn sits in a chair across from and to the left of the entrance. The room has also white benches lining two of the four walls. There is a desk in the corner adjacent to the entrance. Another chair sits next to her, empty except for a black cloth that I assumed was for cushioning. The only other fixations in the room are a rock (centered) and an odd clock, and Marilyn herself.</p>
<div id="attachment_8007" style="width: 239px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8007" class="wp-image-8007 size-full" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/room-layout.jpg" alt="room layout" width="229" height="262" /><p id="caption-attachment-8007" class="wp-caption-text">2/17/2016 &#8211; Day 98 &#8211; Room Layout</p></div>
<p>For the past ninety eight days the artist has spent six hours a day in this bleak room. The performance is meant to explore time. It’s meant to make the audience personally consider time and how they spend their own time. The description outside the room makes clear that the piece is not meant to answer any questions, but it certainly raises a lot. Why is she doing this? What is she thinking? What has she been thinking for all this time? Does she hear the tick and the tock of every second? Does she hear anything at all or is her conscious contained within her own head? Is she glad it’s day ninety eight? The description outside the room is similarly ambiguous and question raising. It touches upon how audience and artist can interact to create and morph the art. Does she speak? Can you speak to her? It’s unclear; the description doesn’t clarify. But she sits with an empty seat next to her. This raises even more questions for me.</p>
<p>People fill the benches, so I sit down on the floor in the corner. I wonder if she meant for this silence to shroud her show. I wonder if she had hoped someone would sit next to her. I wondered what she did with the other eighteen hours of her day. She had a ring on; I supposed maybe she went home to her husband and lived a normal life for the rest of her day. Looking at her drawn, somber face I doubted that her non-museum hours were particularly pleasant either. People go to work for much longer than six hours a day. I wondered if the piece was also a commentary on how people spend much of their time working.</p>
<p>The description was correct and clear in one regard: none of my questions seemed to have any answers. Questions in mind with no answers on hand, I went to find my boyfriend.</p>
<p>Reunited, I asked him what he’d seen and he asked me the same. I told him that I’d been in the performance art room. He had seen the piece from outside the room, and he immediately brought up some of my same questions.</p>
<p>“Can you sit by her? Can you talk to her?”</p>
<p>The ambiguity of the board, intentional or unintentional, lead to our selective reading that we weren’t explicitly not allowed to sit with her. The board read</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left"><em><strong>Marilyn Arsem: 100 Ways to Consider Time</strong> debuts a new performance by Boston-based artist Marilyn Arsem (American, born in 1951). For six hours a day, every day, for 100 days, Arsem will be present here in the Towles Gallery, inserting her living presence into the Museum. Her performance is an invitation to pause and experience the present moment together, providing a temporary respite to the frenetic pace of our modern lives.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Arsem has dedicated her career to exploring the unique characteristics of performance art. These include the unpredictability of its final form and its ability to encompass all the sense—sight, touch, taste, sound, and smell. The medium blurs traditional boundaries between audience and artist, and we encourage you to spend time in the gallery with Arsem. When she is not present, you will hear an audio recording of Arsem made following the end of the previous day’s performance.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">If viewers have the time to allow themselves to slow down with me, small details will become visible. The work could be viewed as if it were a minimalist or abstract painting or sculpture. In that respect, it operates similarly as a kind of opaque or seemingly simple surface that reflects back to the viewers the complexity of their own thoughts. This is not a work that offers answers, but rather provides an opportunity to consider one’s own concerns about the passage of time. –Marilyn Arsem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stuck on phrases like “the unpredictability of its final form,” “the medium blurs traditional boundaries between audience and artist,” and especially “when she is not present, you will hear an <em>audio </em>recording,” I became convinced that we were meant to bridge the gap.  I also became more and more excited about her piece. Beyond questioning time, it seemed to question the boundaries of art. It questioned the relationship between the artist and the audience and the bindings that create those roles. Nowhere was a sign that said “Don’t Touch the Art.” Was she simply sitting alone because no one had chosen to enter her sphere? Was it the Bystander Effect but stretched to encompass any interaction at all? We thought about asking some museum representatives outside the room if we were allowed to speak to her, but they were engaged in a passionate conversation and interrupting seemed rude (somehow ruder than potentially interrupting (but potentially adding to) a hundred day long performance piece). Austin and I went in and sat on the benches.</p>
<p>Marilyn remained straight backed and silent in her seat. The clock ticked.</p>
<p>I couldn’t take it. I had to know.</p>
<p>Maybe it was impatience; maybe it was the desire to understand; I couldn’t take the time, and I couldn’t take the questions. Whatever it was, I whispered</p>
<p>“go sit next to her.”</p>
<p>Austin, intensely curious as well, rose to fall in next to her.</p>
<p>As he approached the seat she stood and swept down on him, suddenly large. She abruptly pointed to the bench.</p>
<p>“YOU sit THERE.”</p>
<p>Hands clenched, she began to pace around the rock. Counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Another woman came over to scold him.</p>
<p>I was furious. Didn’t she understand that she was practically asking us these questions? Didn’t she realize that the second empty chair practically begged for someone to fill it so she wouldn’t seem so alone? Her description didn’t forbid it. If anything, it seemed to encourage interaction. Was her scolding of him a part of the art? Were we all meant to experience time in solidarity?</p>
<p>Feeling protective and confused, I angrily imagined punching her in her old gut. I’m not proud of it, but I did. I imagined punching her right in her black sweater sheathed belly. I glared at her. What was she trying to communicate? It seemed like the piece was supposed to be about spending time together. Why was she dressed in all black, neck to toes? Did she think it made her more of an artist? I didn’t understand. I yearned to understand, but I just didn’t. Arsem’s piece was really raising questions, but I didn’t feel like I got it. It was interesting to me in a few ways. I liked the noisy clock. I liked the unyielding symbolism of the rock. I liked how she paced in a circle as if she herself was inside of a clock. But I didn’t understand. I felt on the cusp of understanding, when my boyfriend stood to leave. I stood with him.</p>
<p>“What did she say to you?”</p>
<p>“She told me not to sit there. When I got close I could see that there was some oily substance on the chair next to her.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything fell into place.</p>
<p>The chair wasn’t meant to be sat in.</p>
<p>She wasn’t meant to be interacted with.</p>
<p>Every day for 98 days she had sat in silence, markedly alone, for 6 hours a day. She didn’t go home to her husband. Her husband had died. The piece was a performance art piece dealing with time in regards to mourning.</p>
<p>Clothed in all black except for her gray hair and her gold wedding ring, she was the icon of a widow. She spent her time publicly mourning her husband instead of at home alone. And she was intensely aware of the time spent. Similarly brilliant was Arsem’s implicitness. Only with interaction (or nearly interaction) would a person know that the chair was unavailable for sitting in. Only then would a person know that she was certainly, decidedly alone. Only then would a person know that when she paces, she paces to turn back time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Googling the piece later, I learned a lot. Marilyn’s piece changes each day. I found that she changes the setup of her props each day. Some days she counts aloud. Some days she talks with her audience. Some days she watches ice melt. <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2015/11/24/arsem-contemplates-duration-mfa-performance/KATWxtYa43P1df65apICdK/story.html">The Globe</a> touches on a number of ways in which the artist conducts performances dealing with time. The only article I could find about her personal life involved a <a href="http://rapidpulse.org/accumulation-decay-an-interview-with-marilyn-arsem">recent interview</a>. Before starting the piece, Marilyn was interviewed by Jeffrey Byrd. In this interview, she speaks of her husband. He had come to almost all of her showings for 30 years. He died in 2012.</p>
<p>Marilyn’s piece is personal, introspective, and ephemeral. Each day it changes. But each day, she wears all black and she considers time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter Moments</p>
<p>The internet has completely uprooted the foundations of the printing press. A material company is constrained by how many copies of a certain product it can produce cost effectively. The internet allows for the creation of unlimited copies for no cost at all. With the integration of the internet into people’s lives came the integration of social media into people’s lives. And, brilliantly, Facebook, social-media-gargantuan, has come to incorporate news into their platform, and thus again into people’s lives.<br />
Initially Facebook was much less news based than it currently is. More and more people consult Facebook for their news. The percentage of people who use Facebook for news is up 16% from 2013. Now 63% of Facebook users consume news while on Facebook (<a href="http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/news-use-on-facebook-and-twitter-is-on-the-rise/" rel="nofollow">http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/news-use-on-facebook-and-twitter-is-on-the-rise/</a>). As Facebook redefines the consumption of news for the average person, other social media groups will likely gain traction as sources of news. When people become more comfortable with the idea of using their social media for news, I suspect Twitter’s “Moments” section will become quite popular. Twitter has a platform that is quick and casual, allowing users to use the mobile app for mere seconds at a time effectively. For better or worse, I see the current direction of news as becoming generally more casual. In order to support that idea, Twitter has a pretty solid news section. Under Moments users can choose between News, Sports, Entertainment, and Fun. Those are some pretty palatable divisions of information, really. Lots of people could probably choose at least three out of four of those sections to just be lumped together under “Fun.” Users can immediately engage in discussion on any topic by tweeting to the hashtag of any event. To open the news section, users touch one button, and then can swipe through different stories.<br />
With such a low barrier of entry and access to immediate interaction and conversation about any given article, I see Twitter’s Moments section as a likely platform/tool to facilitate an ever-more-casual, more prompt news system.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Holly Haney, an undergraduate studying Comparative Media Studies. I&#8217;m interested in a number of things, but I think that it can largely be broken down into, first, the creation/study of different media and, second, the study of social systems and culture. I am especially interested in popular culture, hip hop culture, internet studies, and celebrities. These institutions tell us a huge amount about a large portion of our society and culture. Celebrities and other successful people involved in popular culture create intelligently sculpted characterizations of themselves that I find fascinating.</p>
<p>I create a lot of digital media (photographs, videos, illustrations, and writings), do journalism for the Boston Hassle, work as a radio engineer for WMBR, and just generally really like making things and talking to people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a super friendly person and I love to chat. If you ever want to talk with me, I&#8217;d love to talk with you.</p>
