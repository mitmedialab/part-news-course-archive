								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I interviewed Sands Fish for our class profiles assignment months ago and decided to try to profile him through the medium in which he is an expert: data visualization. However, I ran into a road block that I wasn&#8217;t able to resolve until our data visualization class. So I&#8217;m combining two assignments in one and finally presenting my results.</p>
<p>After Sands and I talked, I transcribed 25 minutes of our interview, including even the &#8220;um&#8221;s and &#8220;yeah&#8221;s. Then I analyzed the text from several different perspectives, trying to echo Sands&#8217; work with MediaCloud, which crunches massive amounts of data to discover the relationships between words and the people who use them. In our case, I wanted to get a visual representation of the themes and rhythm of our interview.</p>
<p>First, I analyzed the language we each used. Here are the words I used most often:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8553" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.52.27-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 10.52.27 PM" width="719" height="305" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.52.27-PM.png 719w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.52.27-PM-300x127.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.52.27-PM-500x212.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></p>
<p>And the ones Sands used most often:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8554" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.53.21-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 10.53.21 PM" width="752" height="347" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.53.21-PM.png 752w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.53.21-PM-300x138.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.53.21-PM-500x231.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t a lot of overlap.</p>
<p>Then I counted the number of words in each uninterrupted chunk of speech and made a spreadsheet recording each of those chunks under our respective names, with the minute timestamp interspersed. For example, here is the first five minutes:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8558" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-11.12.56-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 11.12.56 PM" width="225" height="316" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-11.12.56-PM.png 225w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-11.12.56-PM-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>Here is a streamgraph that shows our individual share of the conversation, and the overall give and take. I used total words per person per minute to produce this graph on <a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org">raw.densitydesign.org</a>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8556" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.56.54-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 10.56.54 PM" width="721" height="528" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.56.54-PM.png 721w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.56.54-PM-300x220.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-10.56.54-PM-410x300.png 410w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /></p>
<p>Then I took a more granular look at the first 10 minutes of conversation, using cumulative word count instead of minutes as the x-axis value. That gave me a better sense of the frequency of volleys between us, and the duration of each uninterrupted chunk of speech:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8560" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-11.15.35-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-19 at 11.15.35 PM" width="723" height="530" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-11.15.35-PM.png 723w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-11.15.35-PM-300x220.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-19-at-11.15.35-PM-409x300.png 409w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>Here are a few takeaways I gleaned about my interview style by representing the interview visually:</p>
<ul>
<li>I affirm understanding in lazy ways (yeah, OK, mhmm), and I interrupt a lot.</li>
<li>It would be better would be to remain silent until the end of my interviewee&#8217;s explanation, and then affirm my understanding in a summary that uses key words and phrases that he or she has shared.</li>
<li>Overall the share of conversation is roughly appropriate for interviewer and interviewee, though the spike at 22 represents a story I shared that probably didn&#8217;t add much to the interview.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a very unusual week due to a few one-off obligations, so my results are rather skewed. I am planning on doing this exercise again in the coming week, with cool graphics. However, initial insights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I spent very little total time on Facebook (30 min for the week) but I checked it many times a day, leading to many interruptions.</li>
<li>All the serious news articles I consumed online came through email newsletters or Facebook. I also read some news in newspaper form.</li>
<li>I spent more time reading about World Cup cross-country skiing results than &#8220;serious&#8221; news, despite the fact that I had to seek out those stories myself rather than seeing them on Facebook or in my email. (It was an outstanding weekend for the US ladies. Still, this is embarrassing.)</li>
<li>I am really surprised how much time I spend texting. I could have read the Wall Street Journal A section all the way through about three times for the amount of time I spent texting &#8211; not to mention all the interruptions that make it take longer to do other things, or prevent you from finishing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>My breakdown by media category, with the type I consumed most of first and least last: movies, videos, email, news, making media, texting, Facebook, iCal, shopping, weather</p>
<p>Lastly, while the rest of the week was kind of a bust, I had a very interesting experience today that taught me more about how to get people to read even when they think they&#8217;re too busy for the news (myself included). In Jerusalem, I always got frustrated that I would post a picture of a stray cat or Palestinian kids playing in the snow and get dozens of likes, but when I posted a story I&#8217;d worked on for weeks, only a few people &#8216;liked&#8217; it.</p>
<p>Today I came across a story on Facebook that some friends (not close friends) had shared and despite my weird week, I was impelled to click on it. It was called, &#8220;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amy-westervelt/having-it-all-kinda-sucks_b_9237772.html">Having it all kinda sucks</a>.&#8221; I found it so compelling that I read all the way through, shared it on my FB page, and tagged a few women friends who are mothers and asked what they thought. That led to the best FB conversation I&#8217;ve ever had on my page. It gave me hope for engaging my FB friends on important topics.</p>
<p>Looking forward to doing this again with a more representative week.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really love this tool that allows reporters to develop their own data visualization components for a story. For years I was forever waiting for an old-school graphics guy to get me maps or charts I had requested, and they always seemed lacking in creativity and dynamism but I didn&#8217;t have the skill set to conceptualize or illustrate something different. This tool allows you to plug your data into a variety of graphs and charts and that experimentation could either lead to something you could publish, take to your data viz guy as a prototype, or expand your concept and enable you to imagine something new altogether. I think it really democratizes the process of data visualization, which is key to keeping readers engaged online, I think.<br />
