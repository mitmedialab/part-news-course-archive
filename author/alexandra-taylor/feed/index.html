								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consciously examining my media consumption over the past week has been a revealing exercise. In addition to looking at the breakdown of what media I consume in a week, I wanted to document what form of media I spend the most time on, how I get to it, and what times of day I spend on different platforms.</p>
<p>The simple answer: Gmail, all day.</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3409" alt="report by categories" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-300x143.png" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-300x143.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-1024x489.png 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories-500x239.png 500w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/report-by-categories.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the las week I spent more than 9 hours on Gmail and scheduling tasks out of the 39 hours I logged on my computer, documented with RescueTime. A close second was writing (time spent on Microsoft Word), followed by social networking sites and news/opinion.</p>
<p>My week looked like this according to RescueTime (w/ hours logged along the vertical axis, day of the week on the horizontal axis, and a key for activity below):</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3418" alt="my week - rescuetime" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-300x113.png" width="300" height="113" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-300x113.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-1024x386.png 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime-500x188.png 500w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/my-week-rescuetime.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in reality, my week looked a lot more like this: my daily schedule with activity color coded on top by four categories (red = email, yellow = entertainment, orange = news, pink = social media):</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3427" alt="schedule" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-300x225.jpg 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/schedule-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combining the data from RescueTime with a notebook log I kept of my media consumption throughout the week, I found that my news consumption tends to happen in the mornings, while I consume more topical/class-related material during the days, and I tend towards entertainment (buzzfeed, netflix) in the evenings.</p>
<p>I had three additional takeaways from this exercise:</p>
<p>1. My media consumption is socially driven</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3431" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-11 at 10.51.41 PM" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-300x192.png" width="300" height="192" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-300x192.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-1024x657.png 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM-467x300.png 467w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-10.51.41-PM.png 1149w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that I spent a lot more time browsing Facebook and Twitter than I expected. I&#8217;m starting to realize that the reason is largely because I pick and choose to read things that my friends share on social networks. For instance, this story on NPR (Facebook link pictured above) was done by a friend of mine and shared by a lot of my friends in the Beirut journalism network. Via social media I am steered towards consuming the stories written or shared by my friends, many of whom share an interest in the Middle East. Not only do I click on these links, but, after examining the open tabs on my browser at the end of the day, I found that I am more likely to go back and actually read/listen to/consume stories shared on my social networks over other links. This concerns me that I may be stuck in a news echo chamber of sorts, dictated by my online social networks.</p>
<p>2. I am a more engaged media consumer in the mornings</p>
<p>By the end of the day, my browser looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3441" alt="tab" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-300x52.png" width="300" height="52" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-300x52.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-1024x177.png 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab-500x86.png 500w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tab.png 1157w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am much more likely to fully consume and repost or share a story if I encounter it in the morning. By the end of the day, I&#8217;m usually operating at information capacity and I&#8217;m less likely to read an article to the end.</p>
<p>3. I consume a lot of offline media</p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3450" alt="photo" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photo-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My coursework at Fletcher keeps me reading hard copies. I spent approximately 8 hours on offline texts (I&#8217;m including my Kindle in this, but that might be a stretch). This material is predominately made up of books and journal articles related to my research and coursework at Fletcher. I&#8217;m not sure if this offline consumption is driven by the environment of being in graduate school, but it certainly cuts into the news consumption time that I spend online and on current events. It&#8217;s interesting that while I do consume offline media, very little of that media is news; rather, it is longer magazine or academic articles or books.</p>
