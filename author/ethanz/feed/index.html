								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For everyone interested in taking MAS.700, welcome! There&#8217;s been a lot of interest in the class this year &#8211; one wonders why, as there&#8217;s nothing going on in the outside world that makes news particularly interesting or important. I am going to assume that people have simply heard that I&#8217;m a style icon and are attending to see my radical and provocative fashion choices.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/14/14/francis-fake.png" alt="Not true." /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the spring 2017 edition of MAS.700, here are a few things to know:</p>
<p>&#8211; You <B>must</B> come to the first class. It&#8217;s from 1-4pm on February 8, in E15-341. (This first class will probably go only 2 hours, but most will be closer to 3 hours with a break.) I will try to accommodate everyone, but there are constraints having to do with the size of the room and the number of assignments I can read each week.</p>
<p>&#8211; There is no passive auditing of any of my classes. You&#8217;re welcome to participate as an auditor, but I expect you to do the work that any student taking the course for credit would do.</p>
<p>&#8211; It doesn&#8217;t matter what university you&#8217;re from. I&#8217;m thrilled to have MIT students &#8211; Media Lab, CMS or otherwise &#8211; in this class, but I&#8217;m equally thrilled to have participants from anywhere in the greater University of Boston. If you&#8217;re affiliated with a university somewhere within driving radius of Cambridge, you&#8217;re welcome here.</p>
<p>&#8211; If I have to limit the size of the class, I will make decisions based on balancing skill sets. This class works best when I have roughly equal numbers of engineers, designers and journalists, plus a few wild cards. </p>
<p>&#8211; The syllabus is in flux. I am making some changes today, and will likely keep adding readings as the semester goes on as this is a really fascinating moment in time and some great writing is taking place.</p>
<p>&#8211; Most students find that this course requires more work than they expect. There&#8217;s three hours of classes a week, and reading will likely take you another 2-3 hours. There&#8217;s an assignment virtually every week, and those tend to take a minimum of 4 hours to complete. If that&#8217;s going to be a problem for you, please give your seat to someone else who wants it.</p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting lots of folks on Wednesday the 8th.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <a href="http://partnews.mit.edu">News and Participatory Media</a>, no longer an experimental course, now officially MAS 700. This blog serves as home base of the class, the place where assignments are posted and commented on, and home for the <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/syllabus/">syllabus</a> and other readings. </p>
<p>News and Participatory Media is a workshop-based class, where we&#8217;ll be creating some of the tools and tactics that allow people making news &#8211; from established print newspapers to individuals with a phone and a twitter feed &#8211; to embrace what&#8217;s best of the world of participatory media while navigating around some of the icebergs. For the first half of the class, students will be reporting stories using a variety of tools and tactics. For the second half, we&#8217;ll be designing and testing new tools and tactics. Reading back through this blog will give you a sense for some of the projects students produced last year.</p>
<p>The class is open to anyone interested in issues of the future of news, but works especially well with students who either have a background in journalism, or in developing software &#8211; some of the most interesting projects happened last year when students who could code worked with students who had deep knowledge of a thorny set of journalistic issues.</p>
<p>Think you might be interested? First class is Wednesday, February 6, at 2pm in the Media Lab, E15-363. The syllabus we&#8217;re using is <a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/syllabus/">located here</a>.</p>
