<div> <a href="http://www.wordle.net/show/wrdl/6479341/Americans_Against_Food_Taxes" title="Wordle: Americans Against Food Taxes"><img src="http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/6479341/Americans_Against_Food_Taxes" alt="Wordle: Americans Against Food Taxes" style="padding:4px;border:1px solid #ddd"></a></p>
<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif">Taxes website looks completely wholesome – almost literally depicting<br />
a Mom and Apple Pie approach to political argument.<br />
The home page features a picture of a diverse group of<br />
smiling Americans as well as a lunch box that contains grapes, a<br />
banana, and yes, an apple.  The home page headings contain virtuous<br />
messages: “Smart Choices for Kids,” “Education Not Taxation,” and<br />
“Healthy Economy.”  Who could be against these?<br />
But, in fact, Americans Against Food Taxes is a front group for<br />
the American Beverage Association, and has a website that uses many<br />
advertising ploys that can be incredibly persuasive.<br />
First, the group’s name is misleading. It implies that it is<br />
against food taxes of all sorts, exaggerating the scope of its<br />
mission.  But in fact, the text only discusses taxes against<br />
sugar-sweetened beverages. This tactic may draw in people who are<br />
concerned about taxes overall. They will be less likely to think about<br />
the much narrower issue of whether there may be health benefits to<br />
taxing sugar-laden drinks.<br />
The website’s home page declares that 95,993 people have<br />
signed up to be part of the group, a classic example of social norms<br />
marketing. This number may convince individuals that it is socially<br />
acceptable – and desirable – to join this group.   In the About Us<br />
page, casual readers may be left with the impression that this is a<br />
wholesome group of folks.  The groups says it is composed of<br />
“responsible individuals, financially strapped families, small and<br />
large businesses in communities across the country.”<br />
But the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity analyzed the<br />
95,993 people who are members and discovered that 93% of them were<br />
somehow associated with food and beverage industry groups – and 83%<br />
had some affiliation with Coca Cola.<br />
“Is it really Americans Against Food Taxes or just Food<br />
Industry Against Food Taxes?” Rudd Center researchers have asked.<br />
I was intrigued by the language used on the home page and<br />
so put it in a word cloud to see what words were used most often.  It<br />
can be seen here:<br />
<a href="http://www.wordle.net/show/wrdl/6479341/Americans_Against_Food_Taxes" target="_blank">http://www.wordle.net/show/wrdl/6479341/Americans_Against_Food_Taxes</a><br />
The wordle shows that words like Americans and taxes are<br />
quite prominent, as well as different variations of the word<br />
“healthy.” Balanced, obesity, exercise, smart, and children also<br />
appear repeatedly. Yet the word “sugar” never appears and the word<br />
“soda” appears less frequently. The overall impression with the words<br />
used can distract readers from the real mission of the group, which is<br />
to fight soda taxes.<br />
Clicking through to the FACTS section of the website,<br />
there are more pointed distortions of policy. It discusses that the<br />
beverage industry was key in creating school beverage guidelines and<br />
points out that nearly 80% of schools are now in compliance with them.<br />
In fact, groups like the American Public Health<br />
Association have criticized these guidelines, saying they’ve left<br />
gaping loopholes that allow kids to buy sugar-sweetened sports drinks<br />
and other unhealthy beverages.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
