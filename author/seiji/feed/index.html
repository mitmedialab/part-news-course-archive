<p>I made a story about clean meat on Graph Commons that you can check out <a href="https://graphcommons.com/stories/f06fc31f-4db4-4aca-8bef-2c22ea23e9f3">here</a>. It&#8217;s a bit light as an explainer piece as it took me a while to find a decent, online graph maker.</p>



<p>Graph Commons is a relatively intuitive tool to use. While I was excited about the speed at which I could build the graph, I quickly noticed difficulties between what I envisioned and what this tool offered.<br></p>



<ul><li>It&#8217;s difficult to create clustering based on your choice of features e.g. food product or investors</li><li>Nodes have categories, the highest level of grouping, and properties which can provide additional information. You can&#8217;t color nodes based on their property.</li><li>Their story feature is shaped around slides and zooming in on sections of the graph. You can&#8217;t have a story where the graph is built (through animation) alongside a main body of text. A good example of this would be <a href="http://fold.cm">fold.cm</a> where the media supports the text.</li></ul>



<p>Still, Graph Commons may be a good tool to draft a graph and export the data to a more customizable tool.</p>



<p>On the general idea of incorporating graphs into storytelling, it&#8217;s much more feasible to have it manually authored rather than computer generated. Although the most useful form of the tool might be a browser extension that generates a graph as you read an article, that&#8217;s difficult. Automatically generating graph networks based on text is an ongoing (read: unsolved) research field for knowledge representations in artificial intelligence. On the hand, having the author create the graph and its animation alongside the article is a natural extension of curating a story into an article, creating a graphical structure alongside a textual one. The trade-off is that requires more work on the author&#8217;s part. This additional work may be offset if the author considers it a valuable tool to use while they&#8217;re crafting the story.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2018, MIT spent $731 million through research expenditures. A large portion of the money came from federal sources like the Departments of Defense, Energy, Health as well as NASA and the National Science Foundation. Within the $731M, $144M came from industry sources like IBM, Google, Lockheed Martin, Exxon Mobil, Wal-Mart, Toyota, and Capital One to name a few. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://web.mit.edu/facts/img/research.FY2018.png" alt="Research Expenditures by Primary Sponsor in Millions: Department of Health and Human Services 16% or $111.83, Foundations and other nonprofits 12% or $86.75, Department of Energy 11% or $82.16, National Science Foundation 11% or $80.41, NASA 6% or $39.80, State, local, and foreign governments 4% or $25.69, All other federal agencies 2% or $17.04, MIT internal 2% or $12.53, Industry 18% or $132.91, Department of Defense 18% or $130.37." /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://web.mit.edu/facts/research-expend.html">MIT Facts 2019</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I got curious in MIT&#8217;s funding sources when <a href="http://www.fossilfreemit.org/">Fossil Free MIT</a> campaigned for the school  to divest its endowment from fossil fuels and President Reif <a href="http://web.mit.edu/climateaction/ClimateChangeStatement-2015Oct21.pdf">declined</a>. Among the possible reasons for his decision, I wondered what MIT had to lose financially. Two potential reasons that stood out were career opportunities for students and research funding. Showing the first with a counterfactual would be difficult, and I was more interested in the second scenario. I found that the data published in the <a href="https://vpf.mit.edu/about-vpf/publications">Brown Book</a> could go a long way towards answering my question.</p>



<p>(The Brown Book is not a public document so I will share aggregate values, not  sponsor level values on this post. See the note at the end and stay tuned for more this semester.)</p>



<p>While the analysis is still ongoing, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve found for 2017: about $720M of sponsored research funding was spent that year by the report was made. If 20% came from industry like it did in 2018, $144M of industry funding was spent. By a manual search for companies whose business is predominately fossil fuel energy, MIT spent $21.2M of fossil fuel money, or 14.7% of industry funding.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oil-pie-chart-crop-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10234" width="446" height="454" /><figcaption>Total pie area represents approximately $21 million.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It would be a logical jump to say that 14.7% is a good or bad number. Each company has varying levels of commitment to sustainability as well as their history with acknowledging climate change. Additionally, one caveat is that although the money comes from profits derived from fossil fuels, the research may in fact be for clean energy. To find out, analysis into other documents published in the Brown Book is necessary (but hasn&#8217;t been done yet).</p>



<p>Other analysis I&#8217;m incorporating is look where the money flows to within MIT at the departmental (or similar) level as well as gender.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oil-crop-1024x546.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10236" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oil-crop-1024x546.png 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oil-crop-300x160.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oil-crop-768x409.png 768w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oil-crop-500x266.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Made in Tableau</figcaption></figure>



<p style="text-align:left">The focus of funding in the chemical and mechanical engineering is logical. The null values in the figure arise from faculty that I haven&#8217;t been able to assign into a department using an automated tool that searches MIT&#8217;s online directory. This prevents me from putting the values in the figure above into context of the respective department&#8217;s spending.</p>



<p>My larger goal is to create a financial transparency tool via interactive data visualizations accessible to all of MIT. I&#8217;d be curious to hear what other kinds of analysis you&#8217;d like to see or better ways to convey the narrative in the visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>Climate change is an issue
that needs to be addressed now.</strong></p>



<p>Global greenhouse gas emissions need to start declining <em>now </em>to reach the 2°C goals to avoid the worst effects of climate change.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pathways-1024x672.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10179" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pathways-1024x672.png 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pathways-300x197.png 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pathways-768x504.png 768w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pathways-457x300.png 457w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pathways.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/">Climate Action Tracker</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>195 of 196 state parties signed the 2015 Paris Agreement with the aim of &#8220;Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change” [<a href="https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&amp;chapter=27&amp;clang=_en">1</a>].</p>



<p>Although communication of climate science has been able to
refute falsehoods used by denialists, a new group of “climate delayers” is
trying to forestall regulation by downplaying the urgency of climate change and
role of regulation. </p>



<p>The Cato Institute, a well-funded think tank with a history of climate change <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/cato-institute/cato-institutes-claim-global-warming-disputed-most/">misinformation</a>, claims that there is “<a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/">ample time</a>” to develop technologies necessary for emissions reduction.</p>



<p>Climate delayers may make similar claims to stall progress on climate change in order to maintain their (or rather their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Money_(book)">anonymous funders&#8217;</a>) profits. For example, the Cato Institute was founded in part by Charles Koch, whose wealth largely originated from oil refining and chemicals.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>March 10, 2019-my lucky day<br> Running to catch  flight et 302 Addis Ababa &#8211; Nairobi, which crashed 6 minutes after  taking off, I had my nerves because there was no one to help me go fast.  I lost it for two minutes, when I arrived, the boarding was closed and I  watched the last passengers in tunnel go in &#8211; I screamed to put me in  but they didn&#8217;t allow it. In fact, the flight lost it because I didn&#8217;t  give a suitcase (otherwise they would expect me for 10-15 minutes or  more, because finding a suitcase loaded wants at least 40 minutes).  Also, as I learned later, I lost her because I came out first and very  quickly from the plane and the connection ambassador who came to receive  me didn&#8217;t find me<br> <br> Airport people, kind, promoted me to the  next flight that would leave at 11:20, they apologized for the  inconvenience and transferred me to a nice lounge for the-waiting.<br> <br>  On 10:50, as we joined the next flight, two security officers informed  me that for security reasons that a senior officer will explain to me,  they will not allow my boarding. In my intense protests they left no  margin of discussion and led me to their superior, to the airport police  department.<br> <br> He told me gently not to protest and say thank you  to God, because I am the only passenger who did not enter the flight et  302 which is missing. And that this was why they can&#8217;t let me go, until  I determine who I am, because I didn&#8217;t get on the flight and  everything. At First I thought he was lying, but his style left no  margin of doubt.<br> <br> I felt the ground lost under my feet, but I  came back in 1-2 seconds because I thought something else would happen,  some communication problem maybe. People were kind, they asked that they  had to ask, they my elements and let me wait.<br> <br> They made me sit in a living room and they told me to wait there until they warn me.<br> <br>  I was looking on the internet to find elements for the flight, friends  from Nairobi informed me that 30 minutes after the expected time had not  landed and there was no information about her luck and suddenly all the  wifi of the airport.<br> <br> Fortunately there are sms &#8211; from close  friend I learned that the flight crashed almost just took off and that  the issue was going out in the Greek media.<br> <br> Then I realized  that I must immediately contact my own people and tell them that I was  not in and that for two small random circumstances I lost the flight &#8211;  the moment I made that thought i collapsed because then exactly I  realized how lucky I stood.<br> <br> This text I wrote to manage my  shock. I&#8217;m posting it because I want to tell everyone that the invisible  and, nēmatídia of fortune, the out-of-plan circumstances knit the web  in which our life is taken. It&#8217;s millions of small threads we almost  never feel &#8211; but one to break is enough to feed the whole web instantly.<br> <br>  Really, it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;m so glad I wrote a post and I&#8217;m grateful  to live and that I have so many friends that made me feel their love &#8211;  kisses to all and a warm thank you for your touching support.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the recently published book, <em>Educated</em>, Tara Westover writes about her experience of how
education exposed to her immensity of the world after having grown up in an
isolated community with her family. As a child growing up in Idaho, she never
saw a doctor and didn’t learn about the Holocaust or the civil rights movement until
college. Our perception of the world is filtered by what (we think) we know. Besides
formal education, our knowledge can come from observation, experience, friends,
family, and media. Of those, media is what private individuals and
organizations can control. The power to control what we think is the reason
that Maggie Hughes, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab, believes “media
has an immense amount of power”. </p>



<p>That power has been twisted and abused worldwide, leading to the popularly used term <em>fake news</em>. Although still rampant, knowledge of its prevalence is spreading through stories about <a href="http://time.com/5168202/russia-troll-internet-research-agency/">Russia</a>, <a href="https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/south-china-morning-post-propaganda?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3">China</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940">climate change</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory">alt-right</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/public-editor/condemning-fake-news-but-running-fake-news-ads.html">online advertisements</a>, and much more. One way to defend against misinformation is to know who publishes it. An analysis from 2018 by ad fontes media plots news source by partisanship and factfulness. Although one may disagree on exactly what source is considered neutral, it shows that as partisanship increases, so does fabricated information.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/media-bias-chart-1024x791.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10099" srcset="https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/media-bias-chart-1024x791.jpg 1024w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/media-bias-chart-300x232.jpg 300w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/media-bias-chart-768x593.jpg 768w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/media-bias-chart-389x300.jpg 389w, https://partnews.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/media-bias-chart.jpg 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.adfontesmedia.com/">ad fontes media</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another way to blunt the effects of disinformation is to encourage self-reflection of biases. Maggie works in the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/social-machines/overview/">Laboratory for Social Machines</a> which has the mission to “conduct analyses and build tools that promote deeper learning and understanding in human networks”. This results in projects such as the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/the-electome-measuring-responsiveness-in-the-2016-election/overview/">Electome</a>, which analyzed Twitter for the popularity of campaign issues during the 2016 election, and <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/social-media-mirror/overview/">Social Mirror</a>, an interactive visualization to help twitter users identify the political polarization of their network.  A third way to fight fake news is to change how news is made. Maggie has been working on a project to enable communities to create their own news and take control of their portrayal in the media. She hopes that this will build empathy between social groups that might be suspicious of each other.</p>



<p>At the same time, she’s “skeptical about the desire to bridge or to bring people together [because] … what’s the halfway point between moral and immoral”. Maggie clarified that statement, “not to say everyone on the right is immoral”, which was reminiscent of Hilary Clinton’s comment describing Trump supporters as a <a href="http://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/">“basket of deplorables”</a>. The sentiment of finding the halfway point echoes the concept of journalistic objectivity. It&#8217;s important to show both sides of the story, but if one is clearly wrong, it doesn&#8217;t deserve equal credibility.</p>



<p>When thinking about the oft-discussed social divisions in the United States today, one question to ask is, what are we fundamentally divided on? Is it something irreconcilable like slavery was in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, which was one cause for the American Civil War? Or, is it a litany of issues including immigration, equal rights for women/minorities/LGBTQ, taxes, economic opportunity, and anti-establishmentism? Are our dividing issues something that we could discuss and work together towards an agreeable outcome? If not, what’s next?</p>

<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Seiji Engelkemier. I&#8217;m interested in working on renewable energy generation and storage as well as other issues relevant to climate change. To that end, I&#8217;m a senior studying mechanical engineering with a concentration in energy (and minor in energy studies). Since I&#8217;ve been at MIT, I&#8217;ve worked on projects involving evaporative cooling, mycelium, silkworms, algae, and thermal power plants. </p>



<p>While I don&#8217;t have a background in journalism or news, I&#8217;m interested in learning more about the field as well as hearing from people with firsthand experience. I found about this class because I talked to Prof. Zuckerman about an interactive financial transparency tool (targeted for institutions) that I&#8217;m currently building. It uses data visualizations to illuminate relationships found in financial data.</p>

<p>By: Seiji Engelkemier<br><br>Start: 12:10 pm <br>End: 4:07 pm</p>



<p>On Sunday February 24<sup>th</sup>, MIT community members consisting of undergraduates, graduates, and employees presented their ideas to improve MIT to a panel of three judges. The participants’ ideas included websites to help students develop intuition for p-set problems, creating a hands-on volunteering room, and expanding capabilities of online learning platforms. These ideas were pitched for the semi-final stage of the weeklong BetterMIT Innovation Design Challenge. </p>



<span id="more-9964"></span>



<p>The BetterMIT Innovation Challenge kicked off on Monday, February 18<sup>th</sup> with a mixer for people to meet potential teammates and to share ideas. This was followed up with a speaker series on Friday before leading into the weekend design challenge and Monday’s presentations by the finalists. The event was hosted by the Undergraduate Association’s technology and innovation committees with the purpose of providing a venue for students to have discussions and access to resources to enable them to solve their own problems.</p>



<p>The judges, who came from MIT’s IS&amp;T,
the Office of Minority Education, and MindHandHeart, listened to seven pitches.
An employee working on edX, an online learning platform, shared a concept to enable
students to access high performance computing (HPC) capabilities on sites like
edX. The motivation for this is to allow hands-on learning of topics like
machine learning and computational biology without the cost barrier of HPC
equipment.</p>



<p>Two first-year students looked at
the frustration students face when dealing with the tension between completing daily
work and their motivation to solve larger, impactful problems. They came up
with the Recharge Room. This would be a place for students to partake in short volunteering
activities like making care packages as a positive outlet for stress. Two
participants, tackling a meta-problem, presented Hacking MIT as an all-in-one
online platform for hackathon organizers and participants to more easily find
events, teammates, and record ideas.</p>



<p>Two pitches converged on the issue
of providing better learning materials for students. The concept called Feynman
focused on an online animated whiteboard where students could share their
problem solving process. The other, Mind Network, focused on a website with written
solution work-throughs that endeavored to make resources traditionally available
to limited groups open to everyone, even outside of MIT. </p>



<p>Mental health was also a shared
topic between two groups. One idea was an app to track users’ feeling, detect
mental health risks, and connect them with peers. This contrasted with the only
non-technology-based idea from the participants. A graduate student shared an
ongoing event called FAIL! where accomplished, mostly academic speakers share
their experiences with failure and how they dealt with it.</p>



<p>After a short period of discussion between the judges, the presenters for Hacking MIT, FAIL!, Recharge Room, and Mind Network were selected to present on Monday to members of MIT’s administration. That audience will include Vice Chancellor Ian Waitz, Dean Suzy Nelson, and Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart. Apart from Recharge Room in 4<sup>th</sup> place, the groups moving onto Monday will also receive cash prizes.</p>

<p>The audience for Sunday’s semi-finalist pitch was small. It consisted of the three judges, participants, and the event organizers. Tables had been set up to accommodate more than 50 people, and the audience mostly sat at their own tables. The event organizers were surprised at the low turnout, having seen at least 65 registrations. They speculated that time commitment and the event format may been challenges in achieving their goal to encourage students to identify problems and access resources to help them develop their solutions. The organizers purposefully avoided using the word hackathon which might connotate software-based solutions and dissuade potential participants. Thus, they went with the more inclusive phrase, “innovation challenge”. Still, they expressed interest in changing the description and even the design of their weeklong event to focus more on promoting productive discussions and connecting students with common interests. They noted anecdotally that conversations around campus revolve around lamenting on commonly experienced problems but often do not evolve into deeper conversations about causation and solutions.</p>

<p>I kept track of my media consumption on Google Keep for the past week and summarized it with a timetable. This past week, I&#8217;ve mostly been working on a research project, so I didn&#8217;t spend much time reading articles &#8211; my primary method of staying up to date. My time outside of class, homework, and human interaction was primarily reading MATLAB and Python documentation. I was mostly surprised that most of my world news comes from NYTimes&#8217; daily briefing. It had me thinking about the trade off between being able to get my attention with phone notifications versus the information bandwidth, which enables deep dives, limited by screen size.</p>
