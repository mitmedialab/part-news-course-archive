								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The very American concept of &#8220;networking&#8221; makes my French soul cry. So Monday afternoon, I decided to attend a workshop at MIT (&#8220;How to talk to strangers&#8221;), in order to understand it all better &#8212; and who knows, maybe start liking it.</p>
<p>In terms of format, I tried something I never did : a first person audio piece. It cost me not to take any pictures, but I did it. The whole thing took me a little more than 4 hours.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How I Lost my Snow Day Trying to Read all the News on the Internet </strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5593" alt="Intro_08" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Intro_08.gif" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s Sunday, outside is 5°, and I won’t go out : perfect day to catch up on the week’s news &#8212; or so I thought. Here’s how and what I read/heard/watched while the world was ending, buried under 70 inches of snow.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Alerts.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5595" alt="Alerts" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Alerts.gif" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Opening eyes around 7.30</strong>, the first thing I do is check my phone (I know, it&#8217;s a bad thing to do). I read a blurry bunch of news notifications that popped on the screen while I slept. I only read the notifications, without opening any of them. This morning, they all describe the terrorist attack that happened in Denmark. This actually can be all that I do to remain informed on a busy day : seeing the world only through media notifications, trusting my apps to tell me only what’s essential, and never reading anything further. But it won’t be enough for a snow storm day, locked inside.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Reveil.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5598" alt="Reveil" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Reveil.gif" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><strong>I bother reaching for my glasses and my iPad</strong>, and let myself drift from link to link, starting with e-mail newsletters (Medium and LeMonde.fr). But Facebook pops up on the screen without me even thinking, and transforms my quest for news by taking me to a post-Valentine’s day feed. I say to myself that this is a little monochrome and irritating, but I end up reading a bunch of Valentine stuff I had no intent to read for an hour, like a map of the world&#8217;s single published on Medium. I emerge from this lukewarm love bath thinking about how I didn’t see anything about the latests event in Copenhagen pop up in my feed. So I finally take a deliberate decision and open The Guardian’s app to read about it. 15 more minutes.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><a style="font-style: normal;line-height: 24.375px;text-decoration: underline" href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Breakfast.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5600" style="border-color: #bbbbbb;background: #eeeeee" alt="Breakfast" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Breakfast.gif" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Next to some almond biscuits my partner and I put on the table</strong>, ends up a smartphone that shouts what NPR One app’s chooses to tell us about the world this morning. We listen closely when a report on Copenhagen comes up. And later complain about a Valentine’s day story (am I trapped?) we had heard two days before. We just turn the whole thing off when a game show comes up, feeling like we didn’t get the news we came for. And we ask : why did we not just play a podcast instead?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><a href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bathroom_01.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5599" alt="Bathroom_01" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bathroom_01.gif" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I’m sorry that I have to drag you into this truth</strong> <strong>about media consumers</strong> : they often read you from their bathroom. Unfortunately, I make no exception &#8212; and open the NYTNow app when I get there. I always say I love this app because unlike the NYT homepage, it makes choices, and doesn’t flood me with tons of things I might not want to read. I scroll through the “News” section for a while, reading stories and saving a bunch of others “for later” &#8212; more stuff from Copenhagen, although the situation is unclear at this point. Then I get to my favorite part of the app : the “Picks” &#8212; where the editors have chosen for me what I should read out of the whole Internet. I rarely click through to any content. I just feel good knowing that these things exist.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><a style="font-style: normal;line-height: 24.375px;text-decoration: underline" href="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Laptop.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5601" style="border-color: #bbbbbb;background: #eeeeee" alt="Laptop" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Laptop.gif" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In an attempt to get some work done</strong>, I open my laptop to the hundred Chrome tabs from my last Internet time. Two starred e-mails later, the sound of Facebook pops in my ear. And in a heartbeat, I’m scrolling down my Facebook feed. This time around, I am flooded with the news of the day : snow is everywhere, more snow is coming, when will the snow end? My Tweetdeck is next on my instinctive desktop habits. I open a bunch of tabs, and jump from one content to another : The Guardian, Medium, Vox, Reddit, NYTimes, Quartz, NYMag&#8230; 90% of topics are about the U.S., and all contents are in English &#8212; which may seem weird for a French journalist, now that I think about it. I read a lot of stuff but the only thing that really strikes me is the Obama interview Vox did : good format, great interview.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5602 aligncenter" style="color: #333333;font-style: normal;line-height: 24.375px" alt="Pocket_09" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pocket_09.gif" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>At night, I find the time to read the choices I&#8217;ve actually made on the whole Internet</strong>: the articles I&#8217;ve saved in Pocket, the read-it-letter app. But while I dwell into reading a bunch of my saved contents, this media diary makes me self-conscious. What is it that I actually choose to “save to read later”? First is an obvious one : (too) long pieces that I&#8217;m afraid I will never read. Second is a little less obvious : bookmarking. Things that I actually already read/watched, but wanted to keep somewhere. They&#8217;re coming from my favorite sources : Vox, NYT, Quartz, The Guardian, Le Monde, etc. No specific topic surfaces, and I feel like, once more, this saved content is still very much a result of my serendipity habits, rather than the reflection of my own interests.</p>
