								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tool I often use to filter and parse my media intake is a third party website called hckrnews.com. The site is actually a tool that categorizes the content from this website: https://news.ycombinator.com/. Y-combinator is a well known incubator based in silicon valley and their blog is relatively influential in the bay area. hckrnews.com makes the site more user friendly by allowing the user to sort content based on user votes, and also allows for sorting content by using the fields of top 10, top 20 and top 50%. Often I find the articles to be interesting in context of the current tech startup climate but they also have many articles of general interest to scientists and thinkers alike. It isn&#8217;t fancy, but the idea of having a good news aggregator with a decent curator coupled with a participatory user voting system can in my opinion make for a good web experience.</p>
