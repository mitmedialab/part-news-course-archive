								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nation needs more social workers. But when they enter the profession, they&#8217;re staring at low salaries and mountains of student debt. How are they handling it?</p>
<p>Gideon Gil and I used the <a href="http://itgetssmaller.cktouch.com/">It Gets Smaller</a> student loan tool to find out. First, we used the income planner tool to identify a profession where student loan payments are projected to make up a high percentage of a person&#8217;s income.</p>
<p>Then we used the second part of the tool, which generated suggested Reddit threads based on our search. The tool connected us to a hoppin&#8217; Reddit forum for social workers. We posted a question asking for stories of how social workers are handling student loans. We got flooded with stories from around the country.</p>
<p><a href="http://itgetssmaller.cktouch.com/explainer/#home">Read the stories here.</a></p>
<p>Gideon and I worked along with Léa Steinacker, Charles Kaioun, Melissa Clark and Luis Guillermo Natera Orozco on the student debt team, which created the <a href="http://itgetssmaller.cktouch.com/">Its Gets Smaller </a>website.</p>
<p>Our hope in creating the website is not only to connect students to better loan information, but also to create a new way to seamlessly connect readers and journalists to social media and Reddit forums, where they can crowdsource advice and more information.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Melissa Bailey and Audrey Cerdan.</p>
<p>Every year, thousands of New Haven parents try their luck in a lottery for schools of &#8220;choice.&#8221; Most walk away disappointed: In 2012, &#8220;9,333 local and suburban students applied for 2,677 open seats at 29 charter and magnet schools covering grades pre-K to 12,&#8221; according to Bailey. Students who live near the school, or already have a sibling in the school, get first dibs on open seats.</p>
<p>Bailey wrote about this in <a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/magnet_lottery_data_released/">a 2013 article</a>. The interviews were good, but the data was &#8230; not so easy for the reader to picture. So Bailey recruited top Parisian digital journalist Audrey Cerdan to try to visualize it better.</p>
<p>Our mission: Give disappointed parents a better sense of their odds in the lottery, to inform their future choices. For example: Maria really wants her daughter to go to Barnard school, which has a fancy vegetable garden and a good reputation. But she lives way across town. What are her chances of getting in?</p>
<p>We answer that question &#8212; and many more &#8212; in this exciting data visualization. Click &#8220;search&#8221; to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="http://c0ebl016.caspio.com/dp.asp?AppKey=4a5e3000170b103a75874671b400"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6811" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-07 at 3.17.42 PM" src="http://partnews.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-07-at-3.17.42-PM.png" width="273" height="91" /></a></p>
<p>We used Caspio because Bailey liked the interactive dropdown menus and got a free account at a recent Super Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference. BUT it was not so easy to use. And in the end we decided bar charts weren&#8217;t the best choice.</p>
<p>Our major hurdle was how to represent the concept of &#8220;zero.&#8221; As in, you have zero chance of getting into that school if you don&#8217;t live nearby. At the end of our struggle with Caspio, we thought of a better way to visualize the data. We think Infogr.am would be a much better way to really give a sense of a person&#8217;s odds. Here&#8217;s a sketch by Cerdan:</p>
