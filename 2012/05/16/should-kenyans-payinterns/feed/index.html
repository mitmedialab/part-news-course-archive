					<description><![CDATA[To write this article, I used DataForager to collect the twitter accounts associated with an article and try to use them to write a followup.

Although DataForager will be more generally useful as I add more data extraction types, its value for writing social media stories is much less than just following a given hashtag. All but one of the people cited in the Global Voices article tweeted about Internships only once. The hashtag is a much better record of the conversation.

Instead of trying to use the twitter accounts to write a followup, an alternative approach would be to follow the twitter accounts in the article to see if another topic emerges-- and then write about that with reference to the social media accounts surfaced by DataForager.]]></description>
