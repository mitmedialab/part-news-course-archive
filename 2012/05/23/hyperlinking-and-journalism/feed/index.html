					<description><![CDATA[A really simple, elegant project. Already kicking around a lot of ideas about how I want to incorporate this.

I&#039;m curious if you considered Microformats as an existing markup. Places, people, topics, etc. have simple and rich markup that could perhaps be migrated to the HTML5 data attributes and then &#039;Hyperlinker&#039; would be more general for encouraging appropriate markup.

thanks again.]]></description>
