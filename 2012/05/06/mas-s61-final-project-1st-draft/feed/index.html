					<description><![CDATA[Hi - I&#039;ve joined some groups on Soundcloud who do field recordings and I&#039;ve found recordings from China, I&#039;d be interested to try, if you are interested, adding a soundtrack to the censorship story and seeing if it works in any way.

I could add the track just above the translations after the intro and people could respond - if no one likes it I&#039;ll just take it down, what do you reckon?
