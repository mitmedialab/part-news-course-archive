					<description><![CDATA[I thought this was a great example of both the challenges and benefits of telling stories with data. I think your intuitions in connecting climate change concern to coal is a really interesting one... and that your polar bear mentions is a great data set that demands analysis. I&#039;m not convinced of the connections you reference in either... and you&#039;re very careful to make clear that you may or may not be either.

On the coal data - we should sit down and try a scatter plot to try to correlate the two sets. I am unconvinced there&#039;s a relationship between the two, but would love to show you a few more tools you might use to explore the space. Also, I think Eugene&#039;s proposed tool for correlating a set with lots of different single variables is an idea the two of you might benefit from discussing together.]]></description>
