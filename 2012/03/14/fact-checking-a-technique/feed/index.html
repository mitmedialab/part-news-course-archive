					<description><![CDATA[Eugene, I love the idea of annotating rap lyrics - Immortal Technique is offering a sufficiently dense set of references that turning those lyrics into some sort of hypertext seems like a worthwhile exercise. It&#039;s interesting to think about how this could best be incorporated - I could imagine something very worthwhile being done using pop-up video - see http://www.rebelliouspixels.com/2012/buffy-vs-edward-html5-pop-up-video-powered-by-popcornjs for an example of one fascinating way to do this.

I think it&#039;s worth considering carrying this out for a full set of lyrics, but I also feel like at a certain point, it&#039;s worth asking how much we&#039;re willing to give IT poetic license for... and at what point assertions like the ones he&#039;s making in these verses are a claim to authenticity that he can&#039;t personally claim.

Also, wassup with that early 80s backing track? I thought we were done with Journey? Have we run out of 60s and 70s soul samples and moved on to mining the early 80s?]]></description>
