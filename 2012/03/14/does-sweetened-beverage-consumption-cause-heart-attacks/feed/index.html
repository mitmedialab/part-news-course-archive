					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve found a great example of a &quot;news you can use&quot; story. These have become increasingly popular, even in high-status US newspapers like the Times and Post, in part because they seem to get blogged and shared widely, as people urge each other not to drink soda. I think you&#039;ve done a nice job of revealing the truth behind many of these studies - their conclusions tend to be more complicated and nuanced than can actually fit into a headline, and the reporting frequently doesn&#039;t dig into that nuance. In this case, though, I think there&#039;s an interesting bit of exploration you might pull out a bit further - if the authors are comparing people who drink very few sugared beverages to those who drink none, is this data we can extrapolate from to the populations who drink lots of sugared beverages? And what factors also come into play - can we control for other aspects of diet in a broader analysis?]]></description>
