					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ethan! Experts argue that more roads lead to more traffic and reduce the livability of the city . Have a look at this http://www.npr.org/2011/07/09/137708751/more-roads-may-pave-way-to-more-traffic

Yes . I will look at Data Sources from other cities to make this point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very helpful analysis, Prathima. I think this is a great example of bringing one data set into focus using another one. I.e., the spending pattern engaged in by JNNURM may seem reasonable, until we consider the distribution of transportation options within urban India.

Where I&#039;d push back on your analysis slightly... it&#039;s possible that solving problems due to overcrowding due to cars would make life more comfortable and reasonable for walkers as well. If flyovers keep cars off streets with heavy pedestrian traffic, perhaps it&#039;s possible that this is evidence of responsible city planning? One thing that might strengthen your argument here is evidence in another jurisdiction - inside or outside of India - of a strategy that invests in a different pattern. There are some great examples from Brazil that might make your case.]]></description>
