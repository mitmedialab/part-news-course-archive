					<description><![CDATA[Matt, I really appreciated your analysis of the shortcomings of some scientific journalism. In discussion in class, you made one of your main points more forcefully - if you can&#039;t find the original study being cited, it&#039;s virtually impossible to see if it&#039;s being presented correctly. 

It might be interesting to see what could be done to make these short pieces more helpful or fairer. One is obviously linking to the original studies. Another might be providing a quick summary paragraph - why you should care, why you shouldn&#039;t take this too seriously. Another might be a simple mouse-over that listed how many data points are in the study, or gave a quick way of looking at the &quot;p&quot; value of a study, the chance that the study&#039;s results could also be explained by sheer randomness...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact you checked is interesting to me because it&#039;s a great example of a self-affirming fact. It&#039;s not written to hereditary millionaires, who are presumably reading something else. It&#039;s written to the rest of us who will congratulate ourselves for being hard-working earners who don&#039;t donate to charity.]]></description>
