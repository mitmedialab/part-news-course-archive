					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting stuff - this is a fascinating topic and one I&#039;d like to understand better. I feel like you&#039;ve put some worthwhile sources forward, but I could use a lot more help to understand what I&#039;m seeing - for one thing, it would be good to get some context on who these actors tweeting are, especially &quot;Official Organ&quot;, which I assume is a parody site. Also, your non-Chinese readers could use some help with translation, as well as with context. Hope you&#039;ll tell us a bit more about this in class.]]></description>
