					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve done your trademark job of producing something that&#039;s fun to read and raises some interesting issues. I like your twist of taking an assignment meant to raise questions about using citizen media to access an otherwise inaccessible story, and using it to consider a heavily mediated event. The coverage of the coverage turns out to be a story in using these techniques to study international news as well. I like that two themes - the depression of being a Sox fan and the facial hair - emerged. I wonder whether there are more ways to use hyperlinks for context - I think of the &quot;lasershow&quot; reference for Pedroia and can&#039;t help think there&#039;s a missed opportunity for a YouTube link there.]]></description>
