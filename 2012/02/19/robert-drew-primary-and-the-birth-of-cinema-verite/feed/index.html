					<description><![CDATA[Helen, excellent job turning both the films and the remarks about them into a coherent and interesting narrative - it&#039;s a great provocation to think about how handheld, home-made looking footage has turned into an everyday reality. I agree the story would have been stronger with one or more images - I think it also could benefit from linking to the rich material you&#039;re talking about here. A product of reporting live, I&#039;m sure, but a surefire way to make this a stronger piece with a few minutes of online work later.]]></description>
