					<description><![CDATA[Godwin, this is very well written, and does an excellent job of connecting an international issue most readers may not be aware of to local debates - I think that framing is very smart, particularly in the context of this story, which is likely to be read primarily by your classmates. :-) I think this is a great example of a story that could benefit from hyperlinks - I really wanted links to more information about Jean Herskovits and the other people quoted in the piece. This is potentially a very &quot;linky&quot; piece, as you&#039;re finding online sources all over the place, including the YouTube debate you reference - hope you can start pulling them into the text!]]></description>
