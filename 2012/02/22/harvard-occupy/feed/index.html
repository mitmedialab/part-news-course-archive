					<description><![CDATA[Actually each bubble title links to the original title. I think with a nice design it would be interesting to see what would be the result of automatically updating a timeline in real time with articles that are being published. I think Google News was doing something like this at some point. I would like to be able to easily visualize the main points that are discussed around a story as it progresses through time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the decision to bring a timeline into this assignment. It&#039;s got terrific potential, and I hope it&#039;s a tool you&#039;ll dig into a bit further. I suspect the optimum use for the tool (not possible within a 4 hour assignment, obviously) is to combine your summaries of events with links to journalistic coverage. And, as mentioned in class, I think there&#039;s lots of potential to build better, open timeline tools for use by journalists. Very cool.]]></description>
