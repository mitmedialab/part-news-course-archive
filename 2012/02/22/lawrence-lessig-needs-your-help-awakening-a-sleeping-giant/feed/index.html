					<description><![CDATA[Matt, you&#039;re getting very, very strong at turning liveblogging into a compelling read. In this case, your subheads are a really important piece of this - they signpost the piece in a very helpful way. I also thought the introduction was compellingly put together and framed. In a non-four hour context, would have loved a closing stretch reacting to Lessig&#039;s talk and offering your thoughts on where he&#039;s on strong and on shakier ground. But perhaps that&#039;s a later companion piece?

(And, of course, I feel awkward putting professorial comments on a piece that&#039;s obviously getting a wider audience than this class, but hey, that&#039;s the joy of writing in public.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding  &quot;... has terminal brain cancer. Would you do nothing?&quot; - ironically, for people with an _incurable_ disease, there&#039;s an argument that &quot;do nothing&quot; is exactly the right answer. That is, aggressive attempts at treating the disease only reduce the quality of life for the sufferer through the pain and misery of the side-effects, and might even end up reducing whatever time they have left via further stressing an already ill body. It&#039;s terrible to say, but sometimes the best option for such a tragedy seems to be simple palliative management, and just enjoy whatever life remains.

Hence, sacrificing oneself for a futile cause is not necessarily advisable.

Was anything deeper said about solving the collective-action problem? (it&#039;s sort of true by definition that if only a few participate, everyone loses).]]></description>
