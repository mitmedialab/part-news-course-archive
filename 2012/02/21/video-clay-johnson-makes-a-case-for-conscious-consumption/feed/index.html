					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m incredibly impressed you were able to pull this off within the time limit - it&#039;s a great example of how to turn long video into short, watchable video. I think the cuts, combined with text slides, was a good solution to the problem given the constraints - I&#039;d urge you to think about cross-cutting between you, offering a sentence or two of context or commentary, and the speaker. Not only will it let you offer a bit more context, it will break up what ends up being a static visual. But this is a very impressive achievement technically, and works well as a thoughtfully-edited story.]]></description>
